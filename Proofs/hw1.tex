\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers. Prove that if $2x^2 - 6x = 2y^2 - 6y$ and $x \neq y$, then $x + y = 3$.  (Be sure to comment or note why it is important that $x\not= y$.)

\item Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Prove that $ab$ is odd if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both odd.

\item Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that if $ab$ is odd, then $a + b$ is even. As always, feel free to reference a previous homework problem.
	\item Is the converse true? Either prove it or give a counterexample.
	\end{enumerate}

\item Let $m$ and $n$ be integers which are greater than or equal to 2. Prove that $mn + 1$ is not divisible by $m$.

\item Let $n$ be an integer such that $n^2$ is even.  Prove that $n^2$ is divisible by 4.

\item Prove that for any natural number $n$, either $n$ is a prime or a perfect square, or $n$ divides $(n-1)!$.
\end{enumerate}
