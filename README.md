This is a website in the very early stages of construction.  It will eventually detail the history and philosophy of science, with automatically and randomly generated exercises on each lesson.  

## Target audience:

The curious of all ages and backgrounds.  For now, restricted to those who speak English and have access to computers and the internet.  

## The agenda:

1) Demonstrate what science really is by walking through the process of **doing** science.

2) Teach the content of university degree programs in Math, Physics, Statistics, Chemistry, Biology, and Logic.

3) Learn some world history while yer at it!

4) Learn a subset of philosophical topics, centered around the philosophy of science.  

5) Provide the full sequence of rigorous arguments and evidence to arrive at important conclusions about geology, evolution, climate change, vaccines, artificial intelligence, abortion, gender identity, political forecasting, and more!
