    <h1>2. Electrostatics</h1>
    <h2>2.1 The Electric Field</h2>
    <h3>2.1.1 Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      We will consider a <b>source charge</b> to be some particle modeled as a point in space with charge magnitude <i>q</i>.  The charge it exerts on a second charge of magnitude <i>Q</i> is given by Coulomb's Law.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.2 Coulomb's Law</h3>
    <p>
      $$ \vec{F} = k\frac{qQ \hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} $$
      
      where \(k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\) and \(\epsilon_0\) is the <b>permitivity of free space</b>.  The force vector is directed from the source to the point.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.3 The Electric Field</h3>
    <p>
      A system of charges generates an electric field determined by the superposition of the forces at any point.  To summarize this we write 
      
      $$\vec F = Q\vec E$$
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      If the system of charges is not a discrete collection then we define the electric field by 
      $$ \vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}dq $$
      
      The typical case is a charge distributed through a volume with density given by \(\rho(\vec{r})\).  Then the formula becomes 
      
      $$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}d\tau'$$
    </p>
    <h2>2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields</h2>
    <h3>2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss's Law</h3>
    <p>
      Field lines draw paths along which a particle would follow the electric field's forces.  The strength of the field is indicated by the density of lines.  We can define the <b>flux</b> through a surface as the number of field lines passing through a closed surface.  Extending this to the continuous case 
      
      $$ \Phi_E \equiv \int_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} $$
      
      The larger the charge on a point, the stronger the field, the more the field line density, the larger the flux.  This is the intuition behind Gauss's law, which states 
      
      $$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = q/\epsilon_0$$
      
      which is to say the flux through an oriented closed surface enclosing a charge is proportionate to the magnitude of charge.  Through superposition we can replace the point charge magnitude with any net charge enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also write a differential version of this law, using the facts that the total charge is \(\int_V\left( \rho/\epsilon_0 \right)d\tau\) and the divergence theorem which transforms 
      
      $$\oint_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = \int_V(\nabla\cdot \vec{E})d\tau$$
      
      and finally using the theorem that if two integrants integrate to the same value over any domain, then the integrands must be equal.  From this we derive 
      
      $$ \nabla\cdot\vec{E}=\rho/\epsilon_0 $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.2 The Divergence of \(\vec{E}\)</h3>
    <p>
      We could have derived the previous result directly from Coulomb's law.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.3 Applications of Gauss's Law</h3>
    <p>
      In cases of particularly neat symmetry we can use Gauss's law to get easy calculations of the electric field.  We wrap charge distributions in Gaussian surfaces, which are closed surfaces over which the field is simple, sometimes constant throughout the surface.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the case of a solid uniformly charged ball with total charge <i>q</i>.  We can wrap this in a surface at radius <i>r</i> so long as it is centered on the ball and large enough to enclose it.  The flux is then \(q/\epsilon_0\) and is the same as \(\int_S |\vec{E}|da\) which of course gives 
      
      $$ \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} = 4\pi r^2|\vec{E}| $$
      
      and notice the avoidance of Coulomb's law.
    </p>
    <p>
      After solving the previous equation for \(|\vec{E}|\) we notice the remarkable fact that the field is the as if the charge had been entirely located at the central point of the ball.  We get the following useful fields through similar methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For a ball:</b> $$ \vec{E} = \frac{kq\hat{r}}{r^2} $$
      <b>For an infinite plane:</b> $$ \vec{E} = \frac{\sigma\hat{n}}{2\epsilon_0}$$
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.4 The Curl of \(\vec{E}\)</h3>
    <p>
      For a point charge the curl of of the field should be zero since the field lines do not curve.  We can directly show that this is as we predict by calculating \(\int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell}\).  In spherical coordinates, using the results of the previous chapter, 
      
      $$\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} = \frac{kq}{r^2}dr$$
      
      Therefore 
      
      $$\int_{\vec{a}}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} = -kq r^{-1}\Big|_{r_a}^{r_b}$$
      
      where \(r_a,r_b\) are the radii of the two points from the origin.  We can then argue that, for any closed curve this evaluates to 0.  Therefore the field is conservative, therefore the curl of it is \(\vec{0}\).  
    </p>
    <h2>2.3 Electric Potential</h2>
    <h3>2.3.1 Introduction to Potential</h3>
    <p>
      Potential energy, \(U(\vec{r})\), is defined in terms of the integral of force through a field.  Since we have defined and studied \(\vec{E}\) as the field of force per unit charge, we can do similarly for potential energy.  This we call the <b>potential</b> and is defined as 
      
      $$V(\vec{r}) = -\int_\mathcal{O}^\vec{r}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell}$$
      
      where \(\mathcal{O}\) is some reference point at which the potential is 0.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We also define the <b>potential difference</b> between points \(\vec{a},\vec{b}\) as \(V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a})\) and simple Calculus shows 
      
      $$V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a}) = -\int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} $$
      
      But by the fundamental theorem of calculus for gradients, 
      
      $$V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a}) = \int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\nabla V\cdot d\vec{\ell} $$
      
      and again since this holds for all domains the integrands must be equal.
      
      $$ \vec{E}=-\nabla V $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.2 Comments on Potential</h3>
    <p>
      (i) We call <b>equipotential surfaces</b> those surfaces throughout which \(V(\vec{r})\) is constant.  
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) That we can recover the vector field \(\vec{E}\) from the scalar function tells us that the components of \(\vec{E}\) are not arbitrary but must be related to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) A choice of a different reference point for two different potentials amounts to adding a constant.  But this doesn't change the potential difference and the gradient.  
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) Potential satisfies superposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      (v) The units of potential are joules per coulomb, which are called <b>volts</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.3 Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation</h3>
    <p>
      Putting together the equations 
      $$ \nabla\cdot\vec{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0 $$
      and
      $$ \vec{E} = -\nabla V $$
      we get <b>Poisson's equation</b>
      $$\nabla^2 V = -\rho/\epsilon_0 $$
    </p>
    <p>
      At points where the charge density is 0 we get <b>Laplace's equation</b>
      $$ \nabla^2 V = 0 $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      By superposition, we can also talk about the potential of a localized charge distribution.  
      
      $$ V(\vec r) = k\int\frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\mathcal{R}} d\tau' $$
      
      This scan be viewed as the solution of Poisson's equation.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.5 Boundary Conditions</h3>
    <p>
      We have in the previous sections seen how we can find any of \(\rho, V, \vec{E}\) from any one of the others.  
    </p>
    <div id="triad"></div>
    <p>
      In fact the direction from \(\vec{E}\) to \(\rho\) really further requires that the field is conservative, which can be certified by ensuring the curl is \(\vec{0}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      The above really seems to have nothing to do with boundary conditions and is such a significant point, I don't know why it isn't contained in its own dedicated section.  It doesn't seem to have all that much to do with boundary conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to now talk about boundary conditions, we can argue that for any surface sheet of charge of density \(\sigma\) there is a discontinuity at the sheet and the field is significantly different below the sheet than it is above.  To analyze this we consider a pillbox thin and wide enough to approximate the flux through the sides as zero.  But the flux is by Gauss's law \(Q/\epsilon_0=\sigma A /\epsilon_0\).  If the field only has components perpendicular to the sheet then 
      
      $$ \vec{E}^{\perp}_{above}-\vec{E}^{\perp}_{below} = \sigma/\epsilon_0 $$
      
      <p>We can interpret this as the amount by which the field changes across a sheet of charge, which is in essence moving over a discontinuity. And if there is any external field then it will be the same on each side of the sheet and therefore cancel in the difference above.  This motivates a more general claim: 
      
      $$ \vec{E}_{above}-\vec{E}_{below}=\sigma\hat{n}/\epsilon_0 $$
      
      where \(\hat{n}\) is the unit vector normal to the sheet.</p>
      
      <p>Note that although the field is discontinuous the potentially is continuous but not necessarily smooth.  We may be motivated by
      
      $$ V_{above}-V_{below} = -\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}}\vec{E}\cdot d\ell $$
    
      and considering points above and below very close to each other so that the potentials are very nearly equal. </p>
      
      <h2>2.4 Work and Energy in Electrostatics</h2>
      <h3>2.4.1 The Work It Takes to Move a Charge</h3>
      <p>Just apply the usual work ideas to the electric field, consolidating a bit with the idea of potential difference, and get 
      
      $$ W = Q(V(\vec{b}) - V(\vec{a})) $$
    
      And of course if we set the point at infinity to 0 then 
    
      $$ W = QV(\vec{r}) $$</p>
      <h3>2.4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution</h3>
      <p>Using the above we can find the work needed to assemble a system of charges one-by-one.  For any one particle brought in when a bunch of others already have been 
      
      $$ W_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} q_iV(\vec{r}_{ij}) $$</p>
      
      <p>If we double-count and then divide by 2 you can sum this over all particles to get the total work to assemble any system of discrete charges. 
      
      $$ W = \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n q_i V(\vec{r}_i) $$</p>
      
      <h4>Problem 2.31</h4>
      <p>(a) Three charges are situated at the corners of a square (side a), as shown inFig. 2.41. How much work does it take to bring in another charge, +q, from far away and place it in the fourth corner?</p>
      <div id="fig2_41"></div>
      <p>(b) How much charge does it take to assemble the whole configuration of four charges?</p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>The work done against the field generated by the particles of opposite charge is identical and each equal to \(-kq^2/a\).  The particle of equal charge is a distance \(\sqrt{2}a/2\) away and therefore the work done against it is \(kq^2/(\sqrt{2}a/2)\).  The total work is 
      
        $$ \frac{kq^2}{a}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}-2\right) $$</p>
        <p>To assemble the entire system you require no work to bring in the first particle, let's say it's negatively charged.  The second negatively charged particle now requires \(kq^2/(\sqrt{2}a/2)\) joules and then the third requires \(-2kq^2/a\) joules.  The last particle we already calculated the energy required to bring it in against the current configuration, so sum them all for the total work.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Problem 2.32</h4>
      <p>
        Two positive point charges, q A and q B (masses m A and m B ) are at
rest, held together by a massless string of length a. Now the string is cut, and the
particles fly off in opposite directions. How fast is each one going, when they are
far apart?
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>We know the potentiall energy, \(kq_Aq_B/a\) and all of it gets converted to kinetic.  But that's kinetic energy of the system, so how does this kinetic energy distribute to the two masses?  Momentum is conserved because this is like a perfectly inelastic collision.  
        
        $$ m_Av_A^2+m_Bv_B^2 = kq_Aq_B/a $$
        
        $$ m_Av_A+m_Bv_B = 0 $$
        
        Solve for the two velocities in terms of known quantities.
        
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Problem 2.33</h4>
      <p>Consider an infinite chain of point charges, ±q (with alternating
signs), strung out along the x axis, each a distance a from its nearest neighbors.
Find the work per particle required to assemble this system.</p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          If we use the formula 
          
          $$ \frac 1 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty q_n V(r_n) $$
          
          we first need the potential at a given particle's location.  The adjacent two particles are opposite sign and distance <i>a</i>, after that they are same-sign and distance <i>2a</i>, and so on.  So 
          
          $$ V(r_n) = 2\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ikq}{ia} $$
          $$ = \frac{2kq}{a}\sum_{i=1}^\infty (-1)^i/i $$
        </p>
          
        <p>
        This sum comes from the Taylor series for $-\ln(x+1)$.  To briefly review this derivation, we know the geometric series 
        
        $$ \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i = \frac{1}{1-x} $$
        
        and the thing on the right looks like \(1/x\) which if we integrate becomes \(\ln|x|\).  Just remember the radius of convergence is 1.
          
        </p>
        
        <p>The up-shot is that \(V(r_n) = \frac{2kq}{a} (-\ln(1+1)) \) and then the work for this particle is 
        
        $$ \frac{1}{2} q \left(- \frac{2kq}{a}\ln 2\right) = -\frac{kq^2\ln 2}{a} $$
        
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>2.4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution</h3>
      <p>Extending the formula at the end of the previous section to a continuous change 
      
      $$ W = \frac 1 2 \int \rho V\ d\tau $$
      
      </p>
      <p>This together with some insane vector calculus can yield 
      
      $$ W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\int \vec{E}^2\ d\tau $$</p>
      
      <h4>Problem 2.34</h4>
      <p>Find the energy in a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius <i>R</i> and charge <i>q</i> in three ways.  (a) Use the potential, (b) use the above formula, and (c) use the intermediate formula which I didn't write.</p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>I won't do part (c) but in part (a) we'll use the potential we found ... well I skipped that exercise but we can do it live.  To find the field outside a solid sphere it's just like all the charge is located at the center.  \(\vec{E} = \frac{kq}{r^2}\vec{r}\) which implies \(V(r) = -\int_{\mathcal{O}}^r \vec{E}\cdot d\ell = kq/r\). To find the field inside is the more challenging part.  But at any point, the charge distribution farther than <i>r</i> from the sphere's center acts like a hull which generates field \(\vec{0}\).  So we just want the field generated inside this hull which amounts to finding the amount of charge.   </p>
        <p>The density being uniform (we should assume) then the charge inside is \(\rho 4\pi r^3/3\) and \(\rho = q/(4\pi R^3/3) \) so we get \(qr^3/R^3\) and the field is then \(\vec{E}=kqr/R^3\) and then the potential difference is 
        $$ V(r) = V(R) + \left( - \int_R^r kqr'/R^3\ dr' \right) $$
        $$ = kq/R - \frac{kq}{R^3} \left( \frac{r'^2}{2}\right){\Big|}^r_R $$
        $$ = \frac{kq}{R}\left(1-\frac{1}{R^2}(r^2-R^2)/2\right) $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to use the formula integrating over all space, 
          
          $$ \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\left( \int_0^R kqr'/R^3\ dr' + \int_R^\infty kq/r'^2 \ dr'\right) $$
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy</h3>
      <p>
        <b>(i) </b> The expressions for work in the two different sections above account for different things: One is the work needed to move a particle through a field and another is the work needed to assemble the field.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>(ii)</b> We cannot say where the energy is as a region of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>(iii)</b> Energy does not obey superposition.
      </p>
      <h2>5 Conductors</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Basic Properties</h3>
      <p>In an <b>insulator</b> electrons are fixed, attached to their atom.  In a <b>conductor</b> they are free to roam.  We will assume an idealization, that there are in principle as many free electrons as we care to use.</p>
      <p><b>(i) \(\vec{E}=\vec{0}\) inside a conductor.</b> If a charge were positive at any point it would push positive charges away and pull negative charges toward.  As long as we don't believe the system will oscillate back-and-forth, with charges swinging between positive regions and negative infinitely, the system must equilobrate to 0 approximately.</p>
      <p><b>(ii) \(\rho = 0\) inside a conductor.</b> A corrolary to (i) since \(\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0\).</p>
      <p><b>(iii) The net charge must be on the surface.</b></p>
      <p><b>(iv) A conductor is an equipotential.</b> Since the charge interior is zero if you then compute the potential difference from one point on the surface to another it's 0. </p>
      <p><b>(v) \(\vec{E}\) is perpendicular to the surface just outside a conductor.</b>  If there were a tangential component it would push around charge as we reasoned about the interior.</p>
      <h3>5.2 Induced Charges</h3>
      <p>
        You can induce a charge on a conductor by holding a charge near it, attracting opposite charges and repelling like charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the charge is located inside a cavity it will attract opposite charge to the interior cavity surface.  The conductor itself will, throughout its internal material, be neutral as we've discussed.  But then on the surface outside the conductor it will be charged the same as the charge in the cavity.  The magnitudes of all of these charges inside and on the surfaces, will be equal.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way it is indistinguishable to have net charge distributed to the outer surface of a conductor, and to have a neutral conductor but with a cavity holding a point charge.
      </p>
      <h3>5.3 Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor</h3>
      <p>
        Consider a general, not necessarily flat, surface charge.  Some part of the surface may exert a significant force on some other part.  Our usual trick of zooming way into a particular point implies that the field just above a small patch, due to that small patch, is \(\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\hat n\).  But with some other field present, that is no longer the entirety of the field, just one component.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's simple enough to figure out what the field just above and below the patch is, because the external field is not discontinuous.
        
        $$ \vec{E}_{above} = \vec{E}_{ext} + \vec{E}_{patch} = \vec{E}_{ext}+\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\hat n $$
        $$ \vec{E}_{below} = \vec{E}_{ext} - \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\hat n $$
      </p>
      <p>
        What we now want to ask is what the force on this small patch (i.e. the force per unit area, or <b>electrostatic pressure</b>) is.  Although the above took the external field to be given and used it to express the field above and below, we now reverse that relationship, taking the field above and below to be given.
        
        $$ \vec{E}_{ext} = \frac{\vec{E}_{above}+\vec{E}_{below}}{2} $$
      </p>
      <p>
        If the sheet is perfectly flat and there's no external field then this result is of course consistent withour previous knowledge.  But there's another interesting application, a conductor.  Here we know that the field internal is \(\vec{0}\) and the field above is \(\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\hat n\).  
      </p>
