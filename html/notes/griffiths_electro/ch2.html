    <h1>2. Electrostatics</h1>
    <h2>2.1 The Electric Field</h2>
    <h3>2.1.1 Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      We will consider a <b>source charge</b> to be some particle modeled as a point in space with charge magnitude <i>q</i>.  The charge it exerts on a second charge of magnitude <i>Q</i> is given by Coulomb's Law.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.2 Coulomb's Law</h3>
    <p>
      $$ \vec{F} = k\frac{qQ \hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} $$
      
      where \(k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\) and \(\epsilon_0\) is the <b>permitivity of free space</b>.  The force vector is directed from the source to the point.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.3 The Electric Field</h3>
    <p>
      A system of charges generates an electric field determined by the superposition of the forces at any point.  To summarize this we write 
      
      $$\vec F = Q\vec E$$
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      If the system of charges is not a discrete collection then we define the electric field by 
      $$ \vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}dq $$
      
      The typical case is a charge distributed through a volume with density given by \(\rho(\vec{r})\).  Then the formula becomes 
      
      $$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}d\tau'$$
    </p>
    <h2>2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields</h2>
    <h3>2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss's Law</h3>
    <p>
      Field lines draw paths along which a particle would follow the electric field's forces.  The strength of the field is indicated by the density of lines.  We can define the <b>flux</b> through a surface as the number of field lines passing through a closed surface.  Extending this to the continuous case 
      
      $$ \Phi_E \equiv \int_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} $$
      
      The larger the charge on a point, the stronger the field, the more the field line density, the larger the flux.  This is the intuition behind Gauss's law, which states 
      
      $$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = q/\epsilon_0$$
      
      which is to say the flux through an oriented closed surface enclosing a charge is proportionate to the magnitude of charge.  Through superposition we can replace the point charge magnitude with any net charge enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also write a differential version of this law, using the facts that the total charge is \(\int_V\left( \rho/\epsilon_0 \right)d\tau\) and the divergence theorem which transforms 
      
      $$\oint_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = \int_V(\nabla\cdot \vec{E})d\tau$$
      
      and finally using the theorem that if two integrants integrate to the same value over any domain, then the integrands must be equal.  From this we derive 
      
      $$ \nabla\cdot\vec{E}=\rho/\epsilon_0 $$
