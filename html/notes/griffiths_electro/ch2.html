    <h1>2. Electrostatics</h1>
    <h2>2.1 The Electric Field</h2>
    <h3>2.1.1 Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      We will consider a <b>source charge</b> to be some particle modeled as a point in space with charge magnitude <i>q</i>.  The charge it exerts on a second charge of magnitude <i>Q</i> is given by Coulomb's Law.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.2 Coulomb's Law</h3>
    <p>
      $$ \vec{F} = k\frac{qQ \hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} $$
      
      where \(k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\) and \(\epsilon_0\) is the <b>permitivity of free space</b>.  The force vector is directed from the source to the point.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.3 The Electric Field</h3>
    <p>
      A system of charges generates an electric field determined by the superposition of the forces at any point.  To summarize this we write 
      
      $$\vec F = Q\vec E$$
    </p>
    <h3>2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      If the system of charges is not a discrete collection then we define the electric field by 
      $$ \vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}dq $$
      
      The typical case is a charge distributed through a volume with density given by \(\rho(\vec{r})\).  Then the formula becomes 
      
      $$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = k\int \frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\mathcal{R}^2}\hat{\mathcal{R}}d\tau'$$
    </p>
    <h2>2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields</h2>
    <h3>2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss's Law</h3>
    <p>
      Field lines draw paths along which a particle would follow the electric field's forces.  The strength of the field is indicated by the density of lines.  We can define the <b>flux</b> through a surface as the number of field lines passing through a closed surface.  Extending this to the continuous case 
      
      $$ \Phi_E \equiv \int_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} $$
      
      The larger the charge on a point, the stronger the field, the more the field line density, the larger the flux.  This is the intuition behind Gauss's law, which states 
      
      $$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = q/\epsilon_0$$
      
      which is to say the flux through an oriented closed surface enclosing a charge is proportionate to the magnitude of charge.  Through superposition we can replace the point charge magnitude with any net charge enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also write a differential version of this law, using the facts that the total charge is \(\int_V\left( \rho/\epsilon_0 \right)d\tau\) and the divergence theorem which transforms 
      
      $$\oint_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{a} = \int_V(\nabla\cdot \vec{E})d\tau$$
      
      and finally using the theorem that if two integrants integrate to the same value over any domain, then the integrands must be equal.  From this we derive 
      
      $$ \nabla\cdot\vec{E}=\rho/\epsilon_0 $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.2 The Divergence of \(\vec{E}\)</h3>
    <p>
      We could have derived the previous result directly from Coulomb's law.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.3 Applications of Gauss's Law</h3>
    <p>
      In cases of particularly neat symmetry we can use Gauss's law to get easy calculations of the electric field.  We wrap charge distributions in Gaussian surfaces, which are closed surfaces over which the field is simple, sometimes constant throughout the surface.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the case of a solid uniformly charged ball with total charge <i>q</i>.  We can wrap this in a surface at radius <i>r</i> so long as it is centered on the ball and large enough to enclose it.  The flux is then \(q/\epsilon_0\) and is the same as \(\int_S |\vec{E}|da\) which of course gives 
      
      $$ \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} = 4\pi r^2|\vec{E}| $$
      
      and notice the avoidance of Coulomb's law.
    </p>
    <p>
      After solving the previous equation for \(|\vec{E}|\) we notice the remarkable fact that the field is the as if the charge had been entirely located at the central point of the ball.  We get the following useful fields through similar methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For a ball:</b> $$ \vec{E} = \frac{kq\hat{r}}{r^2} $$
      <b>For an infinite plane:</b> $$ \vec{E} = \frac{\sigma\hat{n}}{2\epsilon_0}$$
    </p>
    <h3>2.2.4 The Curl of \(\vec{E}\)</h3>
    <p>
      For a point charge the curl of of the field should be zero since the field lines do not curve.  We can directly show that this is as we predict by calculating \(\int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell}\).  In spherical coordinates, using the results of the previous chapter, 
      
      $$\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} = \frac{kq}{r^2}dr$$
      
      Therefore 
      
      $$\int_{\vec{a}}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} = -kq r^{-1}\Big|_{r_a}^{r_b}$$
      
      where \(r_a,r_b\) are the radii of the two points from the origin.  We can then argue that, for any closed curve this evaluates to 0.  Therefore the field is conservative, therefore the curl of it is \(\vec{0}\).  
    </p>
    <h2>2.3 Electric Potential</h2>
    <h3>2.3.1 Introduction to Potential</h3>
    <p>
      Potential energy, \(U(\vec{r})\), is defined in terms of the integral of force through a field.  Since we have defined and studied \(\vec{E}\) as the field of force per unit charge, we can do similarly for potential energy.  This we call the <b>potential</b> and is defined as 
      
      $$V(\vec{r}) = -\int_\mathcal{O}^\vec{r}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell}$$
      
      where \(\mathcal{O}\) is some reference point at which the potential is 0.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We also define the <b>potential difference</b> between points \(\vec{a},\vec{b}\) as \(V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a})\) and simple Calculus shows 
      
      $$V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a}) = -\int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{\ell} $$
      
      But by the fundamental theorem of calculus for gradients, 
      
      $$V(\vec{b})-V(\vec{a}) = \int_\vec{a}^\vec{b}\nabla V\cdot d\vec{\ell} $$
      
      and again since this holds for all domains the integrands must be equal.
      
      $$ \vec{E}=-\nabla V $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.2 Comments on Potential</h3>
    <p>
      (i) We call <b>equipotential surfaces</b> those surfaces throughout which \(V(\vec{r})\) is constant.  
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) That we can recover the vector field \(\vec{E}\) from the scalar function tells us that the components of \(\vec{E}\) are not arbitrary but must be related to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) A choice of a different reference point for two different potentials amounts to adding a constant.  But this doesn't change the potential difference and the gradient.  
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) Potential satisfies superposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      (v) The units of potential are joules per coulomb, which are called <b>volts</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.3 Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation</h3>
    <p>
      Putting together the equations 
      $$ \nabla\cdot\vec{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0 $$
      and
      $$ \vec{E} = -\nabla V $$
      we get <b>Poisson's equation</b>
      $$\nabla^2 V = -\rho/\epsilon_0 $$
    </p>
    <p>
      At points where the charge density is 0 we get <b>Laplace's equation</b>
      $$ \nabla^2 V = 0 $$
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      By superposition, we can also talk about the potential of a localized charge distribution.  
      
      $$ V(\vec r) = k\int\frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\mathcal{R}} d\tau' $$
      
      This scan be viewed as the solution of Poisson's equation.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3.5 Boundary Conditions</h3>
    <p>
      We have in the previous sections seen how we can find any of \(\rho, V, \vec{E}\) from any one of the others.  
    </p>
    <div id="triad"></div>
    <p>
      The above really seems to have nothing to do with boundary conditions and is such a significant point, I don't know why it isn't contained in its own dedicated section.  It doesn't seem to have all that much to do with boundary conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to now talk about boundary conditions, we can argue that for any surface sheet of charge of density \(\sigma\) there is a discontinuity at the sheet and the field is significantly different below the sheet than it is above.  To analyze this we consider a pillbox thin and wide enough to approximate the flux through the sides as zero.  But the flux is by Gauss's law \(Q/\epsilon_0=\sigma A /\epsilon_0\).  If the field only has components perpendicular to the sheet then 
      
      $$ \vec{E}^{\perp}_{above}-\vec{E}^{\perp}_{below} = \sigma/\epsilon_0 $$
    </p>
