    <h1>5. Magnetostatics </h1>
    <h2>5.1. The Lorentz Force Law</h2>
    <h3>5.1.1. Magnetic Fields</h3>

    <p>Magnetic forces are weird, in two ways.  First, they are not the consequence of "magnetic force carriers" in the way that electric force is generated by the charge of a material.  Rather, they are the product of electric charges <i>in motion</i>.  So a charge at rest creates no magnetic forces but a charge in motion does.</p>

    <p>Second, the force law associated with a given magnetic field is not linear in the way that gravity and electricity are.  Rather, it requires the cross-product to express the magnetic force once the magnetic field is known.  This was discovered experimentally by currents carried through wires being placed near each other.</p>

    <h3>5.1.2. Magnetic Forces</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Lorentz's Force Law</b> quantifies the relationship between the magnetic field and the forces that arise.

      $$ \vec F_{mag} = Q(\vec v \times \vec B) $$
    </p>
    <div>
      <b>Example of only a constant magnetic field.</b> <br>
      <p>To get the hang of this let's imagine the simplest field, a constant field.  Suppose an electric charge moves perpendicular to this field.  The cross-product will direct the force orthogonally to both the field and the motion, directing the motion into a curled path.  In general the curvature will be a constant and the particle will trace out a circle.  Since by Lorentz's law the magnitude of force is \(QvB\) then by the equation of centripetal motion, this must equal \(mv^2/R\).</p>
      <p>Of course if the motion were parallel to the field it would generate no force at all.</p>
      <p>These two combined imply that any other motion with some component perpendicular and some parallel entails a helix path running parallel to the direction of the field.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example of a magnetic field and electric field, constant and orthogonal</b> <br>
        Perhaps the next simplest exercise is to consider a constant magnetic field combined with a constant electric field.  We will consider the scenario in which they are orthogonal and a particle is at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the constant electric field will exert a force pushing the particle orthogonal to the magnetic field.  As we've seen before that will cause a curl.  But that means eventually the motion of the particle becomes more predominant orthogonal to the electric field.  The electric field accelerates the particle eventually to a point where the magnetic field exerts a force larger than the electric force, causing the particle to move back in the direction opposite to the electric field.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the long run we get oscillatory behavior even though the particle tends toward \(\vec B\times \vec E\). We can in fact quantify the exact behavior of the system with the couple system of differential equations,

        $$ \vec F = m\vec a $$

        where \(\vec F = Q (\vec E+\vec v\times \vec B) = Q(E\hat z + B\dot z \hat y - B\dot y\hat z) \) by Lorentz's law.  By Newton's laws, \(m\vec a = m(\ddot y \hat y + \ddot z\hat z)\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>There is one important and obvious consequence of the fact that the magnetic force is orthogonal to the direction of motion: Magnetic force never does work.  Initially mysteriious, it will become increasingly apparent that this is merely disguising the fact that work is done in creating the magnetic field.</p>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.1</b>
        <p>Suppose a charge is moving at a constant velocity and suddenly enters a constant magnetic field.  Through a parallel displacement of <i>a</i> inside the field, the particle deflects a distance <i>d</i>.  In terms of <i>a, d, B, q</i>, find the momentum of the particle.</p>
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          This makes a circular arc as discussed earlier.  We can view <i>a, d</i> as playing roles like <i>x,y</i> coordinates in the circle.  With some geometry we find

          $$ (R-d)^2+a^2=R^2 $$

          If we refer back to the result of the previous analysis we could eventually work it into an explicit formulation for the <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> components, with reference to \(E,\omega,B,t\).  But with what we know about <i>R</i> and the fact that \(R = E/(\omega B)\), we can elimate all undesirable variables.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.3</b>
        J.J. Thomson "discovered" the electron by measuring charge-to-mass ratio of cathode rays.
      </p>
      <p>(a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields \(\vec E, \vec B\), and adjusted them until he got zero deflection.  What was the speed of the particle in terms of <i>E,B</i>?</p>
      <p>(b) Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, <i>R</i>, as deflected by the magnetic field alone.  In terms of   <i>E,B,R</i> what is the charge-to-mass ratio?</p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          (a) Zero deflection means the two fields are of the same strength pointing in opposite directions.  So

          $$F_{mag}=qvB = qE $$

          so \(v = E/B\).
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Since \(R=E/(\omega B) = v/\omega\) then we only need to know \(\omega = qB/m\).  Solving for <i>q/m</i> is then easy.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>5.1.3. Currents</h3>
    <p>
      Current is the amount of charge through a fix space per unit time.  We define 1 Ampere to be 1 Coulomb per second.

      $$ 1A = 1C/s $$
    </p>
    <p>
      If the charge moves at a speed <i>v</i> in a wire with density \(\lambda\) then the current is \(I = \lambda v\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we can say \(dq = \lambda \ d\ell\) then we can rearrange Lortenz's law to infer

      $$ F_{mag} = \int (\vec I\times \vec B)\ d\ell $$
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example 5.3, a magnet exerting force to balance gravity</b> <br><br>
        There are two strange facts to reconcile, that magnets exert a force and therefore can really move other particles around; but also, they do no work.  Let's try to make a scenario where a magnet is pushing other stuff around and test out the idea that it does no work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's have a simple system where a magnet does something to keep a weight in place.  If we placed a current in a loop inside a constant magnetic field, that would be somewhat simple to analyze.  But because it's in a loop all the forces will cancel.  So let's put only half in a magnetic field, that way we'll get a net force in one direction.  We'll look at what is necessary for it to balance a weight pushing in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        So imagine you have a region of constant magnetic field and a wire of length <i>4a</i> bent into a square of side length <i>a</i>.  You stick the wire half-way into the magnetic field, and you attach the other half to a weight of mass <i>m</i>.  You then run a current through the wire.  What direction and strength of current do you need in order for the magnetic force to balance the gravitational?
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          The two sides of the square will generate cancelling magnetic forces.  We only need to worry about the side of the wire inside the magnetic field.  Using the right-hand rule, we infer that the if the magnetic field is pointing into the page, the current should be directed clockwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then from the earlier formula, because we have a constant current, the integral along the line becomes <i>IBa</i>, which must balance <i>mg</i>.  Then easily solve for <i>I</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course the interesting question is: What if the current were stronger than this?  Then it would lift the confirguration and do work, no?  The thing is, for an infinitesimal moment this is correct, but as the configuration gains speed, the forces due to the magnet change, which change the speed, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This motion causes a rotation of the configuration and therefore the magnetic field will begin to exert a force resisting current flow.  If we assume that the current is constant then whoever is maintaining the current must be doing more work to push current along the wire.  This is the true source of work.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We extend the notion of current to a surface with <b>current density</b> \(\vec K\). We can imagine that the surface is made up of a bunch of wires.  If each wire has width \(d\ell_\perp\) and current \(d\vec I\) then we define

        $$ \vec K = \frac{d\vec I}{d\ell_\perp} $$
      </p>
      <p>
        From a second perspective you can imagine some point on the surface with surface charge density \(\sigma\).  If it's moving at velocity $\vec v$ then the current is \(\sigma \vec v\).  
      </p>
