    <h1>5. Magnetostatics </h1>
    <h2>5.1. The Lorentz Force Law</h2>
    <h3>5.1.1. Magnetic Fields</h3>

    <p>Magnetic forces are weird, in two ways.  First, they are not the consequence of "magnetic force carriers" in the way that electric force is generated by the charge of a material.  Rather, they are the product of electric charges <i>in motion</i>.  So a charge at rest creates no magnetic forces but a charge in motion does.</p>

    <p>Second, the force law associated with a given magnetic field is not linear in the way that gravity and electricity are.  Rather, it requires the cross-product to express the magnetic force once the magnetic field is known.  This was discovered experimentally by currents carried through wires being placed near each other.</p>

    <h3>5.1.2. Magnetic Forces</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Lorentz's Force Law</b> quantifies the relationship between the magnetic field and the forces that arise.

      $$ \vec F_{mag} = Q(\vec v \times \vec B) $$
    </p>
    <div>
      <b>Example of only a constant magnetic field.</b> <br>
      <p>To get the hang of this let's imagine the simplest field, a constant field.  Suppose an electric charge moves perpendicular to this field.  The cross-product will direct the force orthogonally to both the field and the motion, directing the motion into a curled path.  In general the curvature will be a constant and the particle will trace out a circle.  Since by Lorentz's law the magnitude of force is \(QvB\) then by the equation of centripetal motion, this must equal \(mv^2/R\).</p>
      <p>Of course if the motion were parallel to the field it would generate no force at all.</p>
      <p>These two combined imply that any other motion with some component perpendicular and some parallel entails a helix path running parallel to the direction of the field.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example of a magnetic field and electric field, constant and orthogonal</b> <br>
        Perhaps the next simplest exercise is to consider a constant magnetic field combined with a constant electric field.  We will consider the scenario in which they are orthogonal and a particle is at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the constant electric field will exert a force pushing the particle orthogonal to the magnetic field.  As we've seen before that will cause a curl.  But that means eventually the motion of the particle becomes more predominant orthogonal to the electric field.  The electric field accelerates the particle eventually to a point where the magnetic field exerts a force larger than the electric force, causing the particle to move back in the direction opposite to the electric field.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the long run we get oscillatory behavior even though the particle tends toward \(\vec B\times \vec E\). We can in fact quantify the exact behavior of the system with the couple system of differential equations,

        $$ \vec F = m\vec a $$

        where \(\vec F = Q (\vec E+\vec v\times \vec B) = Q(E\hat z + B\dot z \hat y - B\dot y\hat z) \) by Lorentz's law.  By Newton's laws, \(m\vec a = m(\ddot y \hat y + \ddot z\hat z)\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>There is one important and obvious consequence of the fact that the magnetic force is orthogonal to the direction of motion: Magnetic force never does work.  Initially mysteriious, it will become increasingly apparent that this is merely disguising the fact that work is done in creating the magnetic field.</p>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.1</b>
        <p>Suppose a charge is moving at a constant velocity and suddenly enters a constant magnetic field.  Through a parallel displacement of <i>a</i> inside the field, the particle deflects a distance <i>d</i>.  In terms of <i>a, d, B, q</i>, find the momentum of the particle.</p>
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          This makes a circular arc as discussed earlier.  We can view <i>a, d</i> as playing roles like <i>x,y</i> coordinates in the circle.  With some geometry we find

          $$ (R-d)^2+a^2=R^2 $$

          If we refer back to the result of the previous analysis we could eventually work it into an explicit formulation for the <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> components, with reference to \(E,\omega,B,t\).  But with what we know about <i>R</i> and the fact that \(R = E/(\omega B)\), we can elimate all undesirable variables.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.3</b>
        J.J. Thomson "discovered" the electron by measuring charge-to-mass ratio of cathode rays.
      </p>
      <p>(a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields \(\vec E, \vec B\), and adjusted them until he got zero deflection.  What was the speed of the particle in terms of <i>E,B</i>?</p>
      <p>(b) Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, <i>R</i>, as deflected by the magnetic field alone.  In terms of   <i>E,B,R</i> what is the charge-to-mass ratio?</p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          (a) Zero deflection means the two fields are of the same strength pointing in opposite directions.  So

          $$F_{mag}=qvB = qE $$

          so \(v = E/B\).
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Since \(R=E/(\omega B) = v/\omega\) then we only need to know \(\omega = qB/m\).  Solving for <i>q/m</i> is then easy.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>5.1.3. Currents</h3>
    <p>
      Current is the amount of charge through a fix space per unit time.  We define 1 Ampere to be 1 Coulomb per second.

      $$ 1A = 1C/s $$
    </p>
    <p>
      If the charge moves at a speed <i>v</i> in a wire with density \(\lambda\) then the current is \(I = \lambda v\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we can say \(dq = \lambda \ d\ell\) then we can rearrange Lortenz's law to infer

      $$ F_{mag} = \int (\vec I\times \vec B)\ d\ell $$
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example 5.3, a magnet exerting force to balance gravity</b> <br><br>
        There are two strange facts to reconcile, that magnets exert a force and therefore can really move other particles around; but also, they do no work.  Let's try to make a scenario where a magnet is pushing other stuff around and test out the idea that it does no work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's have a simple system where a magnet does something to keep a weight in place.  If we placed a current in a loop inside a constant magnetic field, that would be somewhat simple to analyze.  But because it's in a loop all the forces will cancel.  So let's put only half in a magnetic field, that way we'll get a net force in one direction.  We'll look at what is necessary for it to balance a weight pushing in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        So imagine you have a region of constant magnetic field and a wire of length <i>4a</i> bent into a square of side length <i>a</i>.  You stick the wire half-way into the magnetic field, and you attach the other half to a weight of mass <i>m</i>.  You then run a current through the wire.  What direction and strength of current do you need in order for the magnetic force to balance the gravitational?
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          The two sides of the square will generate cancelling magnetic forces.  We only need to worry about the side of the wire inside the magnetic field.  Using the right-hand rule, we infer that the if the magnetic field is pointing into the page, the current should be directed clockwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then from the earlier formula, because we have a constant current, the integral along the line becomes <i>IBa</i>, which must balance <i>mg</i>.  Then easily solve for <i>I</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course the interesting question is: What if the current were stronger than this?  Then it would lift the confirguration and do work, no?  The thing is, for an infinitesimal moment this is correct, but as the configuration gains speed, the forces due to the magnet change, which change the speed, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This motion causes a rotation of the configuration and therefore the magnetic field will begin to exert a force resisting current flow.  If we assume that the current is constant then whoever is maintaining the current must be doing more work to push current along the wire.  This is the true source of work.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We extend the notion of current to a surface with <b>current density</b> \(\vec K\). We can imagine that the surface is made up of a bunch of wires.  If each wire has width \(d\ell_\perp\) and current \(d\vec I\) then we define

        $$ \vec K = \frac{d\vec I}{d\ell_\perp} $$
      </p>
      <p>
        From a second perspective you can imagine some point on the surface with surface charge density \(\sigma\).  If it's moving at velocity $\vec v$ then the current is \(\vec K = \sigma \vec v\).  Then

        $$ \vec F_{mag} = \int (\vec v \times \vec B)\sigma \ da $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise we can extend to three dimensions.  We use the notation \(\vec J = \frac{d\vec I}{da_\perp} = \rho\vec v\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example 5.4, current through a wire</b> <br><br>
        Suppose a current is uniform through a circular wire.  Find the current density.
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          Current density generalized to three dimensions translates to "current per unit area" so

          $$ J = \frac{I}{\pi a^2} $$
        </p>
      </div>
      <p> As a follow-up problem, suppose the current density is proportional to the distance from the axis.  Now find the current.</p>

      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          We can rearrange \( \vec J = \frac{d\vec I}{da_{\perp}} \) into \(d\vec I = \vec J da_{\perp} \) and realize that all components are pointing in a single direction so that

          $$ \int dI = I = \int J\ da = $$
          $$ \int (ks)(s\ ds d\phi) = 2\pi k s^2 \ ds = $$
          $$ \frac{2\pi k}{3} s^3\Big|_0^a = 2\pi ka^3/3 $$
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Given that generally, for current crossing a surface $S$, the total current is given by \(I=\int_S J\ da_\perp = \int_S\vec J\cdot d\vec a\).  If we imagine the surface is closed then charge can flow in or out of the surface, and the current is the rate of this flow.  I.e.

        $$ I = -\frac{dq}{dt} $$

        where <i>q</i> is the charge enclosed.  It would be nice to relate this to the charge density over the enclosed space.  We can relate each to a volume integral, the first one regarding the net charge as the integral over charge density.

        $$ q = \int_V\rho\ d\tau $$

        Then using the Divergence Theorem,

        $$ I = \oint_S \vec J \cdot d\vec a = \int_V (\nabla\cdot \vec J)d\tau = $$
        $$ -\frac{d}{dt}\int_V\rho \ d\tau$$

        If we pack everything strictly inside the integrals and use the equality of these over any surface then

        $$\nabla \cdot \vec J = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} $$

        This is called the <b>continuity equation</b>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.4</b>
        <br><br>
        If \(\vec B = kz\hat x\) find the force on a square loop lying in the <i>yz</i>-plane centered at the origin, carrying a counterclockwise current if seen down the <i>x</i>-axis.
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          The continuity equation will be useless here, not sure why this problem is here.  But we will just use the Lortentz equation with \( \vec I = I\langle 0,d\ell, 0\rangle, \quad \vec B = \langle kz, 0, 0\rangle \).  If we draw out the picture and look at the lower edge of the loop we realize that along this path <i>z = -a/2</i>.  Then the component of force due to this segment is

          $$ \vec F = I\int \langle 0, d\ell, 0\rangle \times \langle kz, 0, 0\rangle = $$
          $$ I\int_{-a/2}^{a/2}(-kz d\ell \hat x) = \left(-Ik\int_{-a/2}^{a/2}(-a/2)\ d\ell\right)\hat x =  $$
          $$ \frac{Ika}{2}(a)\hat x = \frac{Ika^2}{2}\hat x $$
        </p>
        <p>
          We could proceed like so along each other edge, but intuitively the two lateral sides of the edge will merely cancel out.  On the other hand your right-hand rule and the swap in the direction of the magnetic field above and below the axis should convince you that the top and bottom edges actually constructively combine.  By symmetry we expect them to be equal in magnitude, so the net force on the loop is

          $$ Ika^2 \hat x $$
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.5</b>
        <br><br>
        Current flows down a circular wire.
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) If the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the wire, what is the surface current density?
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) If it's inversely proportional to distance from the axis?
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          (a) \(K(2\pi a) = I\) solve for <i>K</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) \( \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^a (k/r)(r\ dr \ d\theta) = I \) which evaluates to

          $$ 2\pi k\int_0^a dr = 2\pi k a $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the goal of the problem is to find the surface current density we must solve for <i>k</i> and use this in the expression for <i>J</i>.

    <h2>5.2. The Biot-Savart Law</h2>
    <h3>5.2.1. Steady Currents</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>steady current</b> is one which satisfies

        $$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0, \quad \frac{\partial \vec J}{\partial t} = \vec 0 $$

        In particular the first equation implies \(\nabla \cdot \vec J = 0\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>5.2.2. The Magnetic Field of a Steady Current</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The magnetic field of a steady line current is given by the <b>Biot-Savart law</b>

        $$\vec B(\vec r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int\frac{\vec I\times \hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2}d\ell' $$

        and since the magnitude of \(\vec I \) is constant we can move it outside the integral if we track direction with \(d\vec \ell'\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example 5.5</b>
        <br><br>
        Suppose current runs through a thin wire.  What is the magnetic field generated at a point far from the wire?
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          In the textbook Griffiths parameterizes the curve by \(\theta\) and this is certainly the simplest solution.  But we could also compute

          $$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\vec \ell'\times \hat{\mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} $$

          where \( d\vec\ell' = \langle d\ell',0,0\rangle \) and \(\hat{\mathcal{R}}\) and \(\mathcal{R}^2\) can be computed from

          $$ \vec{\mathcal{R}} = \langle \ell', s, 0\rangle $$
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We could apply the lesson above to this scenario:  Two parallel wires carry a current.  What magnetic force do they exert on each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        First let's establish the geometry at a high level.  Suppose the currents run in the same direction.  Using the right-hand rule, think about the direction of the magnetic field.  Pointing one finger along the second current in Griffiths' diagram, and middle finger toward the first wire.  Your thumb points toward you (out of the page) so that's the direction of the magnetic field along the second wire.  The opposite is true when you switch the roles of the wires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next imagine the force due to the magnetic field.  Using the right-hand rule for \(\vec I \times \vec B\) you should find that the force pushes the second wire away from the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the lesson from above, looking at the second wire, \(B = \frac{mu_0 I}{2\pi d} \) which we then pass into the Lorentz law equation to find force.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Example 5.6</b>
        <br><br>
        A circular loop carries a current.  Find the magnetic field at a point above the center of the circle.
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          First think about a small chunk of current on the loop and what magnetic field it creates (moving on a short distance tangent to the loop).  Importantly the cross-product will have the same magnitude at each such chunk and rotate with a rotation around the loop.  This should convince us that the components parallel to the plane will cancel.  This leaves only the vertical component.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the vertical component we'll first compute the magnitude of \(d\vec B\) for each small chunk on the loop.

          $$|d\vec B| = | d\vec \ell' \times \hat{\mathcal{R}} | = d\ell'$$
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture in Griffiths' convinces us that \(\theta\) is the separation between \(d\vec B\) and the vertical.  Hence \(d\vec B \cos\theta\) is the vertical component and has magnitude \(d\ell'\cos\theta\).

          $$ B(z) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi}\int \frac{d\ell' \cos\theta}{\mathcal{R}^2} = $$
          $$ \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi}\cdot \frac{\cos\theta}{\mathcal{R}^2}\cdot 2\pi R $$
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For surfaces and volumes the Biot-Savart law generalizes to surface and volume charge densities.

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Problem 5.8</b>
        <br><br>
        Find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop.
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          All vectors should point up, for each chunk around the wire, and each side contributes the same.  So we only compute along a single edge of length <i>a</i>.  This amounts to the same as with a point away from a thin wire which we computed before.  We only change the bounds of integration.  Here I parameterize in terms of the angle, as Griffiths did.

          $$\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi} \int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4} \left(\frac{\cos^2\theta}{s^2}\right)\left(\frac{s}{\cos^2\theta}\right) \cos\theta \ d\theta = $$
          $$ \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi s}\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\cos\theta\ d\theta = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi s}(\sin(\pi/4)-\sin(-\pi/4)) = $$
          $$\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi s}2(\sqrt{2}/2)$$
        </p>

    </div>
    <h2>5.3. The Divergence and Curl of \(\vec B\)</h2>
    <h3>5.3.1. Straight-line Currents</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
      We consider again an infinite thin wire and the magnetic field it generates.  We already know that at a single point a distance <i>s</i> away the field strength is \(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi s}\) and direction is determined by the right-hand rule.  If you consider the collection of all points a distance <i>s</i> away and accumulate all of these magnetic field vectors, simple considerations can show

      $$ \oint \vec B \cdot d\vec \ell = \mu_0 I $$

      Since the expression is actually independent of <i>s</i> then we can infer that this would hold for any closed loop encolsing the wire, regardless of whether it's circular.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we can then infer that if we had a bundle of wires, the same would be true acting in superposition:

      $$ \oint \vec B \cdot d\vec \ell = \mu_0 I_{enc} $$
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course a bundle of wires is like integrating over the charge density,

      $$ I_{enc} = \int \vec J \cdot d\vec a $$
    </p>
    <p>
      Stokes law then tells us

      $$ \int (\nabla \times \vec B) \cdot d\vec a = \mu_0\int \vec J \cdot d\vec a $$

      so

      $$ \nabla \times \vec B = \mu_0 \vec J $$
    </p>
    <p>
      However it remains to see what happens if the wires are not straight.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>5.3.2. The Divergence and Curl of \(\vec B\)</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        This result requires knowing something about differential forms which I skip.  All that's important is that we can take the divergence of \(\vec B\) directly from its Biot-Savart form to obtain

        $$ \nabla \cdot \vec B = 0 $$

        which is geometrically unsurprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        By a similar direct application and use of differential forms, we also get

        $$ \nabla \times \vec B = \mu_0 \vec J $$

        even when the wire is not straight.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>5.3.3. Ampere's Law</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The expression derived above for the curl of \(\vec B\) is called <b>Ampere's Law</b> in differential form.  Converting to integral form

        $$ \oint \vec B \cdot d\vec \ell = \mu_0 I_{enc} $$

        Coulomb is to Gauss as Biot-Savart is to Ampere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>

          Use symmetry so \(\vec B\) is constant and factors out of the interal, hence \(\oint \vec B\cdot d\vec \ell = B2\pi s\).  Solving for <i>B</i> is easy.

          It should be easy to prove that, parallel to the current, the magnetic field is zero.  If we parameterize our surface such that the flow is in the <i>x</i>-direction and the surface otherwise extends in the <i>y</i> then we can argue the <i>z</i>-component is zero too.  This is because of cancelling components.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <i>y</i>-direction for a point above the plane the field points left.  Drawing a rectangular loop parallel to the plane and perpendicular to the flow, the field is constant on the top and bottom of the loop.  Along each vertical edge the top part cancels the bottom because of the switching direction of the field.  Thus the Amperian integral evaluates to \(2B\ell\).  Then use Ampere's law together with \(I_{enc} = K\ell\) to solve for <i>B</i> in terms of <i>K</i>.
