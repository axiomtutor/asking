    <h1>4. Electric Fields in Matter </h1>
    <h2>4.1. Polarization </h2>
    <h3>4.1.1. Diaelectrics</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Dialectrics</b> are insulators, matter with charges fixed to them.  Still the fields they generate can be distorted: stretching and rotating.
    </p>
    <h3>4.1.2. Induced Dipoles</h3>
    <p>
      One way to cause stretching is to put a charge near an electrically neutral atom.  This will push the positive protons in one direction and the electrons in the other, creating a dipole.  For reasonable strengths of the field acting on the dipole, the effect is proportionate to the strength of the field, i.e. 
      
      $$ \vec p = \alpha\vec E $$
      
      We call \(\alpha\) the <b>atomic polarizability</b> and it depends on the structure of the atom in question.  
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      The picture complicates when we discuss molecules because their structure can be quite complex.  In particular they can polarize more readily in one direction than another.  We may apply a field in each direction, <i>x, y, z</i> and measure the resulting polarizability.  In general any field \(\vec E = \langle E_x,E_y,E_z\rangle\) results in a polarization in any of the different directions \(p_x,p_y,p_z\).  This is summarized in a <b>polarizability tensor</b> related to the system of equations
      
      $$ p_x = \alpha_{xx}E_x + \alpha_{xy}E_y + \alpha_{xz}E_z $$
      $$ p_y = \alpha_{yz}E_x + \alpha_{yy}E_y + \alpha_{yz}E_z $$
      $$ p_z = \alpha_{zx}E_x + \alpha_{zy}E_y + \alpha_{zz}E_z $$
    </p>
    <h3>4.1.3. Alignment of Polar Molecules</h3>
    <p>
      Some molecules, like water, have a built-in permanent dipole.  When in the presence of a constant electric field the net force is zero since the force on the positive charge balances that one the negative.  However there is a torque force 
      
      $$ \vec N = \vec r_+\times \vec F_+ + \vec r_- \times \vec F_- $$
    </p>
    <p>
      The center of the dipole moment will be the "lever arm" and so using \(\vec d/2\) and \(-\vec d/2\) as the the lever arms in the torque equation and exchanging \(\vec F = q\vec E\), we get
      
      $$ \vec N = q\vec d\times \vec E = \vec p\times \vec E $$
    </p>
    <h3>4.1.4. Polarization</h3>
    <p>
      From the previous discussions we can now summarize that, in a dialectric, if the atoms are neutral then we can induce a charge and the induced dipoles line up with the field.  If the atoms form a natural dipole they still line up with the field.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In any large body that is polarized we can define \(\vec P\) the dipole moment per unit volume.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next several sections we will now forget the field that caused polarization.  Instead we will consider the field that now results from the polarized body.
    </p>
    <h2>4.2. The Field of a Polarized Object</h2>
    <h3>4.2.1. Bound Charges</h3>
    <p>
      The obvious trick in light of defining \(\vec P\) is to find the field caused by a polarized body by integrating a bunch of small dipoles. Potential has the simplest form in terms of a dipole, so we use that.
      
      $$ V(\vec r) = k\int_V\frac{\vec{P}(\vec r')\cdot \hat{ \mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} \ d\tau'$$
      
      But using some obscure vector analysis integration by parts, we end up with the result that: <b>the potential and the field of a polarized object is the same as what would be produced by a volume charge density defined by </b>
      
      $$\rho_b = -\nabla\cdot\vec P$$
      
      <b>plus a surface charge density defined by </b>
      
      $$\sigma_b = \vec P\cdot \hat n$$
      
      We call these the <b>bound charges</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>4.2.2. Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges</h3>
    <p>
      The surface charge part of the above makes sense: If you line up charges, the interiour ones cancel but the ends leave a positive and negative charge.  If you consider all these tubes of charge in total you can understand how the aggregate comes out like a surface charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the volumetric part, if the polarization is non-uniform then charges accumulate inside the mass.
