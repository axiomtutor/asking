    <h1>4. Electric Fields in Matter </h1>
    <h2>4.1. Polarization </h2>
    <h3>4.1.1. Diaelectrics</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Dialectrics</b> are insulators, matter with charges fixed to them.  Still the fields they generate can be distorted: stretching and rotating.
    </p>
    <h3>4.1.2. Induced Dipoles</h3>
    <p>
      One way to cause stretching is to put a charge near an electrically neutral atom.  This will push the positive protons in one direction and the electrons in the other, creating a dipole.  For reasonable strengths of the field acting on the dipole, the effect is proportionate to the strength of the field, i.e.

      $$ \vec p = \alpha\vec E $$

      We call \(\alpha\) the <b>atomic polarizability</b> and it depends on the structure of the atom in question.
    </p>
    <p>

      The picture complicates when we discuss molecules because their structure can be quite complex.  In particular they can polarize more readily in one direction than another.  We may apply a field in each direction, <i>x, y, z</i> and measure the resulting polarizability.  In general any field \(\vec E = \langle E_x,E_y,E_z\rangle\) results in a polarization in any of the different directions \(p_x,p_y,p_z\).  This is summarized in a <b>polarizability tensor</b> related to the system of equations

      $$ p_x = \alpha_{xx}E_x + \alpha_{xy}E_y + \alpha_{xz}E_z $$
      $$ p_y = \alpha_{yz}E_x + \alpha_{yy}E_y + \alpha_{yz}E_z $$
      $$ p_z = \alpha_{zx}E_x + \alpha_{zy}E_y + \alpha_{zz}E_z $$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 4.1</h3>
    <p>
      A hydrogen atom (with the Bohr radius of half an angstrom) is situated
between two metal plates 1 mm apart, which are connected to opposite terminals of
a 500 V battery. What fraction of the atomic radius does the separation distance <i>d</i>
amount to, roughly? Estimate the voltage you would need with this apparatus to
ionize the atom. [Use the value of α in Table 4.1. Moral: The displacements we’re
talking about are minute, even on an atomic scale.]
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        An angstrom is \(10^{-10}m\) so the fraction is \(0.5\times 10^{-10}/10^{-3} = 5\times 10^{-6} m\).
      </p>
      <p>
        From the table earlier in the chapter \(\alpha = 0.667\).  Now we also want to decide what "ionize" means, and in this setting that might just mean offsetting the center of the eletron cloud half an angstrom relative to the proton.  It's somewhat arbitrary, but whatever amount of separation we want we can achieve by following the logic below.  When it is in this configuration the field and the restoring forces between the charges should be in equilibrium.  So the field magnitude is equal to the force that the electron exerts on the proton.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's calculate the force of the electron on the proton at a distance of half an angstrom.  From the above \((0.667)E = p = qd\).  If we use that <i>q</i> is the elementary charge and <i>d</i> is half an angstrom, solve for <i>E</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 3</h3>
    <p>
      The induced dipole moment of an atom is, as we said, pro-
portional to the external field. This is a “rule of thumb,” not a fundamental law,
and it is easy to concoct exceptions--in theory. Suppose, for example, the charge
density of the electron cloud were proportional to the distance from the center, out
to a radius <i>R</i>. To what power of <i>E</i> would <i>p</i> be proportional in that case? Find the
condition on <i>ρ(r)</i> such that proportionality will hold in the weak-field limit.
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        We assume the density is proportionate to <i>r</i>,

        $$ \rho(r) = cr, \quad r < R $$

        This might require explicit calculation of the field and dipole moment.  Since we're still talking about a dipole in equilibrium the field must balance with the restoring force.  So the field we want is equal the field generated by the electron at the point of the proton.  The easiest calculation of this field given the charge distribution is with Gauss's law, where we fit a sphere centered at the center of the electron and passing through the proton.  We will need the charge within that sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get <i>Q</i> we integrate over spherical shells each of volume approximately \(4\pi r'^2\ dr'\) so that the net charge is

        $$ \int_0^r \rho(r') 4\pi r'^2 \ dr' = 4\pi\int_0^r cr' \cdot r'^2\ dr' $$
        $$ = 4c\pi [r'^4/4]_0^r = c\pi r^4 $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Gauss's law tells us \((4\pi r^2 )E = Q/\epsilon_0\) so

        $$ E = \frac{cr^2}{4} $$

      </p>
      <p>
        Although this is the strength of the field genderated by the electron cloud at equilibrium, it is at equilibrium at a distance <i>d</i> in a dipole where <i>p=qd</i>. And this shows <i>p</i> is proportionate to the square-root of <i>E</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 4</h3>
    <p>
      A point charge <i>q</i> is situated a large distance <i>r</i> from a neutral atom of polarizability \(\alpha\).  Find the force of attraction between them.
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        First we imagine that the charge <i>q</i> creates a dipole in the atom.  Once that dipole exists, we imagine it exerts a force on the charge <i>q</i>.  To know the moment of the dipole that the charge creates, we first consider the field generated by the charge, \(E = kq/r^2\).  Then use \(\vec p = \alpha \vec E\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we know the dipole moment we want to know the strength of the field it generates on the point charge <i>q</i>.  Since one can be sure the dipole axis is on the line between the charge and the atom, we only need \(E_r = \frac{2kp\cos\theta}{r^3}\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>4.1.3. Alignment of Polar Molecules</h3>
    <p>
      Some molecules, like water, have a built-in permanent dipole.  When in the presence of a constant electric field the net force is zero since the force on the positive charge balances that one the negative.  However there is a torque force

      $$ \vec N = \vec r_+\times \vec F_+ + \vec r_- \times \vec F_- $$
    </p>
    <p>
      The center of the dipole moment will be the "lever arm" and so using \(\vec d/2\) and \(-\vec d/2\) as the the lever arms in the torque equation and exchanging \(\vec F = q\vec E\), we get

      $$ \vec N = q\vec d\times \vec E = \vec p\times \vec E $$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 5</h3>
    <p>
      \(\vec p_1, \vec p_2\) are perfect dipoles a distance <i>r</i> apart, directed orthogonally.  \(\vec p_2\) is directed away from \(\vec p_1\)  What is the torque on \(\vec p_2\) due to \(\vec p_1\)? (More precisely, the torque on one about its own center.)
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        We just find the field due to \(\vec p_1\) and use \(\vec N = \vec p_2\times \vec E\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 6</h3>
    <p>
      A perfect dipole is situated a distance <i>z</i> above an infinite grounded conducting plane, making an angle \(\theta\).  Find the torque on the dipole.  If the dipole is free to rotate, in what orientation will it come to rest?
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        This problem is similar enough to the infinite conducting plane near a point charge, in which we used the method of imagines because the direct approach was too difficult.  But this time there's an assymmetry.  The head of the dipole indicates a direction associated with the positive charge and so on that side, attracts negative charge on the plane; vice versa for the tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        To try to imagine an image which satisfies the same boundary conditions, you could imagine the reflection of the given dipole across the plane.  But since we need positive charges near the tail, like in the plane, we need to flip the orientation of the dipole.  Let's confirm that in fact the boundary conditions are the same, which is to say that the potential through the plane is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the argument from last time, we again know that the potential is 0 through the plane in the conductor.  So we need it to be 0 again in the case of images.  In this case, at any point on the plane we can compute the field due to the dipoles, sum them, and we will see that the field points vertically, i.e. orthogonal to the plane.  Thus if we brought a point charge in from infinity, along the plane, the potential would be 0 throughout its path.  They indeed satify the same boundary conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now we need to find the force exerted on the dipole by the image dipole.  This is as in the previous section, and can be found by taking the gradient of \(-V_{dip} = -(kp\cos\theta)/r^2\).  Then use \(\vec N = \vec p \times \vec E\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 7</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
         Suppose that we drag the dipole in from infinity in some fixed orientation \(\vec d\).  You can regard this as bringing the negative charge in and then the positive along the same path but stopping at a point \(\vec d\) relative to the electron--it's easiest to imagine a straight line which both particles use, but the positive particle stops early.  The energy is then just the difference between the work done by the field on these two particles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symmetry can be useful here.  We know that if the positive particle completed exactly the same path as the negative, the total work done would be zero.  So although the description above is useful, let's change strategies to use the symmetry insight  Bring the negative in to its position along the direction of the dipole.  Now bring the positive in on exactly the same path so that they lie on top of each other--the work done by the field is now a net zero.  Now push the positive charge out along \(\vec d\) to its correct location.  Since \(\vec d\) is very small we can regard the field as constant along this path, and the work done is \(q\vec E\cdot \vec d\).  After rearranging, you get \(\vec p\cdot \vec E\) and since this is the work done by the field, the change in potential energy is the negative of this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 8</h3>
    <p>Show that the interaction energy of two dipoles separated by \(\vec r\) is

    $$ U = k\cdot\frac 1 {r^3} [\vec p_1 \cdot \vec p_2 - 3(\vec p_1\cdot \hat r)(\vec p_2\cdot \hat r)] $$</p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        This involves a formula from an exercise in a previous section which I didn't bother to solve, so I'm skipping this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>4.1.4. Polarization</h3>
    <p>
      From the previous discussions we can now summarize that, in a dialectric, if the atoms are neutral then we can induce a charge and the induced dipoles line up with the field.  If the atoms form a natural dipole they still line up with the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any large body that is polarized we can define \(\vec P\) the dipole moment per unit volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next several sections we will now forget the field that caused polarization.  Instead we will consider the field that now results from the polarized body.
    </p>
    <h2>4.2. The Field of a Polarized Object</h2>
    <h3>4.2.1. Bound Charges</h3>
    <p>
      The obvious trick in light of defining \(\vec P\) is to find the field caused by a polarized body by integrating a bunch of small dipoles. Potential has the simplest form in terms of a dipole, so we use that.

      $$ V(\vec r) = k\int_V\frac{\vec{P}(\vec r')\cdot \hat{ \mathcal{R}}}{\mathcal{R}^2} \ d\tau'$$

      But using some obscure vector analysis integration by parts, we end up with the result that: <b>the potential and the field of a polarized object is the same as what would be produced by a volume charge density defined by </b>

      $$\rho_b = -\nabla\cdot\vec P$$

      <b>plus a surface charge density defined by </b>

      $$\sigma_b = \vec P\cdot \hat n$$

      We call these the <b>bound charges</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <div class="ex">
      <div><b>A uniformly polarized sphere</b></div>
      <p>
        If a sphere is uniformly polarized meaning that all of the dipoles point in the same direction with the same strength, call the unit polarization through the material \(\vec P\).  Since it is constant the gradient, and therefore the equivalent charge density, is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we orient our coordinates so that the dipole points along the <i>z</i>-axis then in the usual coordinates \(\sigma_b = P\cos\theta\) which means that along the surface of the sphere, the equivalent charge density is weakest at the sides and strongest at the ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find the potential due to this configuration, we can use $$ V = k\int_\infty^{\hat r_0}\frac{\rho}{r}d\tau $$ where there is a separation of the integral between the region outside and inside the sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one might start to guess based on the patterns of previous results, in this case when the calculations are carried to completion, we find that outside the sphere the potential is just as if a single perfect dipole were located at the center of the sphere.  One only has to equate the dipole density with a single dipole divided by the volume of the sphere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 10</h3>
    <p>
      Calculate the bound charges if \(\vec P(\vec r) = c\vec r\) in a sphere of radius <i>R</i>.  Find the field inside and out.
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        This time there is no preferred orientation of the axes since the dipole density is spherically symmetric.  From the geometry one would expect that there would be a relative weakness of negative tails in the center and strength of positive charges at the surface.  You might then guess that this acts as a spherically symmetric charge distribution at every shell, growing in strength outward.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$ \sigma_b = \vec P \cdot \hat n = P = cR$$

        $$ \rho_b = -\nabla \cdot \vec P $$

        For the latter we use the formula

        $$ \nabla \cdot \vec v = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2v_r) + \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(\sin\theta v_\theta) + \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial v_\phi}{\partial \phi} $$

        where \(\vec v = \vec r = v_r \hat r + v_\theta \hat \theta + v_\phi \hat \phi\) and so \(v_r = r\) whereas all other component functions are 0. So \(\rho_b = -c\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2(r)) = -3c\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the sphere the surface charge density is like a point charge with magnitude \(cR\cdot 4\pi R^2\).  \(\rho_b\) also acts like a point charge with magnitude \(-3c\cdot \frac 4 3 \pi R^3\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>4.2.2. Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges</h3>
    <p>
      The surface charge part of the above makes sense: If you line up charges, the interiour ones cancel but the ends leave a positive and negative charge.  If you consider all these tubes of charge in total you can understand how the aggregate comes out like a surface charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the volumetric part, if the polarization is non-uniform then charges accumulate inside the mass.
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 13</h3>
    <p>
      A long cylinder of radius <i>a</i> carries uniform polarization \(\vec P\) perpendicular to its axis.  Find the electric field inside the cylinder and show that the field outside can be expressed as

      $$ \frac{a^2}{2\epsilon_0 s^2}[2(\vec P\cdot \hat s)\hat s - \vec P] $$
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        Because the unit polarization is uniform we know that the volumetric bound charge is 0, as it's the negative gradient of polarization.  The surface charge is the same as if there were two copies of the cylinder, one positive and the other negative, shifted by some small \(\vec d\).  We can use Gauss's law to get the field at any point in the interior due first to the positive and then the negative.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two fields are each parameterized by vectors eminating from the centers of the two cylinders.  Some moderate vector calculus shows that the sum of the two fields, involving a difference of the relative displacements, is equivalent to \(\vec d\) and you get a very simple solution in terms of the polarization.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a point outside the cylinder, you can regard the two imagined cylinders as lines of charge to derive the given formula.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>4.2.3 The Field Inside a Dialetric</h3>
    <p>
      This section contains some comments on the field very close to a dipole.  I think it's skip-able so I'm skipping.
    </p>
    <h2>4.3 The Electric Displacement</h2>
    <h3>4.3.1 Gauss's Law in Dielectrics</h3>
    <p>
      We now know how a charge can induce a dipole in a dielectric, and it produces what we call the bound charge \(\rho_b\).  If we regard every other charge as the "free charge" \(\rho_f\) then using \(\epsilon_0\nabla \cdot \vec E = \rho = \rho_b+\rho_f = -\nabla\cdot \vec P + \rho_f\) we can solve for

      $$\rho_f = \nabla\cdot(\epsilon_0\vec E + \vec P) $$

      Note that here we take only the volumetric charge density strictly inside the dialectric so that the surface charge generates no field there.  Also note that \(\vec E\) is the total field.  The stuff in parentheses we denote by \(\vec D\) and call it the <b>electric displacement</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="ex">
      <p>
        Suppose a wire of charge runs through a rubber tube.  Find the free charge.
      </p>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          We first fit a Gaussian surface which is a cylinder passing through any point inside the rubber.  By symmetry we can first infer that the polarization is symmetric and then infer that the total field is symmetric, so the electric displacement must be too.  This justifies using the Gauss's law approach and the rest is simple.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 4.15</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        If a spherical shell of inner radius <i>a</i> and outer radius <i>b</i> has polarization defined by \(\vec P = \frac k r \hat r \).  Find the electric field in the three regions by two methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Locate all the bound charge and use Gauss's law.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Find the electric displacement and then get \(\vec E\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        a)
        $$ \sigma_b = \vec P \cdot \hat n = \pm k/r $$
        at each point on the outer and inner surface.  It is positive on the outer, negative on the inner.  For points inside the material
      </p>
      <p>
        $$ \rho_b = -\nabla\cdot \vec P = -\frac 1 {r^2} \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial r}r^2P_r \right) $$
        $$ = -\frac 1 {r^2} \left( \frac \partial {\partial r} r^2 k/r \right) = -\frac 1 {r^2} k$$
      </p>
      <p>
        To confirm that this makes sense let's see that the total charge is 0.  On the outer surface the net charge is \(4\pi b^2 k/b\) and on the inner surface \(-4\pi a^2k/a \).  And throughout the material \( \int_a^b (-k/r^2) (4\pi r^2) \ dr = -4\pi k (b-a) \).  Since this sums to zero we may be on the right track.
      </p>
      <p>
        From here we now just have a system of charges and can solve this using the techniques of before.  To address part (b) we use the equation \(\oint \vec D \cdot d\vec a = Q_{f_{enc}} \) but the charge here is the free charge ... and in this problem there is none.  So the integral over \(\vec D\) is zero entailing \(\vec D = \vec 0\).  So from \(\vec D = \epsilon_0 \vec D + \vec P\) we infer \(\vec D = -\frac {\vec P}{\epsilon_0} \).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem 4.4.16</h3>
    <p>Suppose the field inside a large piece of dielectric is \(\vec E_0\) so that \(\vec D_0 = \epsilon_0\vec E_0+\vec P\).</p>

    <p>(a) A small spherical cavity is hollowed out of the material.  Find the field at the center in terms \(\vec E_0, \vec P\).  Also find the displacement at the center in terms of \(\vec D_0, \vec P\).  Assume the cavities described below are small enough that the fields involved are uniform.  <i>Hint:</i> Carving out a cavity is the same as super-imposing an object of opposite polarization.</p>

    <p>
      (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to \(\vec P\).
    </p>

    <p>
      (c) Do likewise for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to \(\vec P\).
    </p>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        (a) As the hint suggests, we place a polarized material in the location of the hollow, with opposite polarization \(-\vec P\).  The field due to this sphere is, as discussed earlier in the book which I may have skipped, \(-\frac{\vec{P}}{3\epsilon_0} \).  Then \(\vec E = \vec E_0 - \frac{\vec{P}}{3\epsilon_0} \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have the field, we can stop thinking about a negatively polarized material superposed.  We can merely say \(\vec D = \epsilon_0 \vec E\) and use the previous result, and the fact that \(\vec D_0 = \epsilon_0 \vec E_0 + \vec P\).
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) A needle is effectively a thin and long cylinder.  Since the volumetric bound charge in a negatively polarized material that we might superpose is zero, all that matters is the ends.  But those are so small and far apart that these are also effectively zero.  Then \(\vec E = \vec E_0\).
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) If we add a negatively charged wafer this is sort of the opposite of the needle scenario.  The wafer is mostly surface area, so it has the maximum impact on the field.  In fact the surface bound charge is like a parallel plate with \(\sigma = -P\) on one side and \(\sigma = P\) on the other.  Inside the plates the field is \(\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\hat n\).  So \(\vec E = \vec E_0 - \frac{\vec{P}}{\epsilon_0} \).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>4.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        It may seem like the displacement is just like an electric field, but importantly it is not guaranteed to be conservative.  In particular the curl is not always zero, but since the curl of the electric field is, then we can say

        $$ \nabla\times \vec D = \nabla\times\vec P $$

        Because displacement is not conservative, it has no equivalent to a "potential".  The integral must be evaluated using direct calculations rather than the fundamental theorem of line integrals or other threoms that deepend on conservatism.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Boundary Conditions</h3>
    <div>
      <p>

        The equation

        $$\int D\cdot d\vec a = Q_f$$
         tells us the discontinuity in the component perpendicular to an interface.

         $$D^{\perp}_{above} - D^{\perp}_{below} = \sigma_f$$

        The argument for the above goes exactly the same as it did for the electric field, using a thin Gaussian pillbox.  On the other hand, the previous argument for the parallel component no longer applies.  For the electric field we argued that the parallel component must be zero otherwise our system would not be in equilibrium.  Here charges are not free to flow and that no longer is convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But because we know the field will still have no parallel component, we can say that the difference in the displacement is the difference in the polarization.

    <h2>4.4 Linear Dielectrics</h2>
    <h3>4.4.1 Susceptibility, Permitivity, Dielectric Constant</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        For many substances

        $$ \vec P = \epsilon_0\chi_e \vec E $$

        where \(\chi_e\) is the <b>electric susceptibility</b> of the medium and is dimensionless (the dimensions are accounted for in the permitivity of free space).  When this approximation is valid we call the material a <b>linear dielectric</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this definition we gain an obvious simplification of the displacement

        $$ \vec D = \epsilon_0(1+\chi_e)\vec E = \epsilon\vec E $$

        where we call \(\epsilon\) the <b>permitivity</b> of the material.  We also call the following the <b>relative permitivity</b>:

        $$ \epsilon_r = \frac \epsilon {\epsilon_0} = 1+\chi_e $$
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Example 4.5</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        A metal sphere of radius <i>a</i> carries charge <i>Q</i>.  It is surrounded, out to radius <i>b</i>, by linear dialectric material of permativity \(\epsilon\).  Find the potential at the center.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        Traditionally to get the potential we want the field.  Here to get the field, we would perhaps want to find the bound charge of the dielectric as we have in the past.  But the polarization is first due to \(\vec E\) and we've come full-circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless we can calculate \(\vec D\) using the free charge.  We fit a Gaussian surface around it and use the diplacement Gauss's law.

        $$ \vec D = \frac Q {4\pi r^2}\hat r\ \ \ \ \text{ for \(r>a\)} $$

        And of course inside a metal sphere the field is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now \(\vec E = \vec D/\epsilon\) in the material and \(\vec E = \vec D/\epsilon_0\) in free space.  With this we can next find the potential by bringing a particle in from infinity to the center.  Naturally we divide the path into those parts outside the dielectric, the part inside, and the part inside the sphere.  Of course the part inside the sphere contributes nothing to potential.

        $$ V = - \int_\infty^a\vec E\cdot d\vec \ell = -\frac 1 \epsilon_0 \int_\infty^b\frac {kQ} {r^2}dr - \frac 1 \epsilon_0 \int_b^a \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon r^2}dr $$
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        You might suspect that since linear dielectrics are proportional to the field then the displacement is then conservative like the field.  Unfortunately the equation is only true in most of space, and not in all of space--but this exception is enough to make the field not conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular at the interface between one dielectric and another, the integral of a closed path around that interface will make \(\vec E\) vanish but \(\vec P\) will not.  What's interesting about this is that the displacement would be conservative if we further required that the material fill all of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a free charge <i>q</i> is embedded in a large dielectric, the field it produces is \(\vec E = \vec D/\epsilon = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r\).

    <h3>Example 4.6</h3>

      <p>
        A parallel plate capacitor is filled with a dielectric with constant \(\epsilon_r\).  What effect does this have on the capacitance?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        If \(\vec E_0\) is the field without the dielectric,

        $$\vec E = \frac 1 {\epsilon_r} \vec E_0 $$

        similar to what we saw just above with a point charge.  This immediately implies the relationship between potential differences.  From \(C = Q/V\) we get \(C = \epsilon_r C_{vac}\).

    <h3>Problem 4.18</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The space between plates of a parallel plate capacitor (density \(\sigma\)) is filled half with one linear dielectric and half with another.  Each slab of dielectric has thickness <i>a</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Find \(\vec D\) in each slab. <br><br>
        (b) Find the electric field \(\vec E\) in each. <br><br>
        (c) Find the \(\vec P\). <br><br>
        (d) Find the potential difference between the plates. <br><br>
        (e) Find the location and amount of all bound charge.  <br><br>
        (f) Now that you know the free and bound charge, recalculate the field.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        Suppose the plates are horizontal.  We draw a Gaussian pillbox through the top so that it reaches out of the plate into a region where we know the polarization is zero.  Also because the plates are responsible for all the electrical charge, we should expect the field outside the plates is also zero, so the flux through the surface outside is 0.  The walls of the pillbox should by symmetry experience a net zero "flux".  Inside the dialectric we have a uniform field from the plate, and planar symmetry should convince us that the strength of the polarization should be symmetrically distributed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the "electric displacement flux" is <i>DA</i>, but is also equal to the enclosed free charge.  So \(DA = \sigma A\) which interestingly indicates that the displacement is independent of the distance into the material.  Somewhat sensible, actually, if you imagine the parallel plates make pseudo-parallel plates of polarization. All of them exerting a constant force.  Anyway, of course the above implies \(D = \sigma\), which is true in both materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        For (b), from the above we can infer \(\vec D = \epsilon \vec E\) so that \(E = \sigma/\epsilon_1\) in the first slab, and likewise for the second.
      </p>
      <p>
        For (c) we can simply apply linearity of the dialectric.  For (d) we integrate directly.  For (e) we use the bound charge formula.  For (f) of course use Coulomb's law.

    <h3>Problem 19</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose you half-fill a capacitor with a dialectric.  How does the change in capacitance depend on wether you fill it in the middle of the capacitor or packed all to one side?
    </p>
    <div class="sol question">
      <p>
        If you pack the material in the middle you use the same technique as above, with some of the material having permitivity the permitivity of free space.  But if it's all packed to one side,

    <h3>Problem 20</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose a linear dialectric has a free charge density \(\rho\) embedded within it.  If it is a sphere of radius <i>R</i> and dialectric constant \(\epsilon_r\), find the potential at the center of the sphere relative to infinity.
    </p>
    <div class="sol question">
      <p>
        To find the potential we want to find the field.  For any Gaussian sphere inside the material, the displacement flux is \(D(4\pi r^2)\) and the enclosed charge is \(\frac 4 3 \pi r^3 \rho \).  From knowing the displacement we find the field.  Of course outside the material we only use the radius of the material, <i>R</i>.  Now calculate the potential difference by direct integration of the field.

    <h3>Problem 21</h3>
    <p>
      Find the capacitance in a coaxial cable with the space between the central wire and the outer tube filled with a linear dialectric.
    </p>
    <div class="sol question">
      <p>
        For any Gaussian tube passing symmetrically through the dialectric, the displacement is constant by symmetry.  And the enclosed charge is just the charge on the cable.  Linearity tells you the field.

    <h2>4.2 Boundary Value Problems with Linear Dialectrics</h2>
    <div>
      <p>

        In a homogeneous isotropic linear dialectric, the bound charge density is proportional to the free charge density

        $$ \rho_b = -\nabla\cdot\vec P = -\nabla \cdot \left( \epsilon_0\frac{\chi_e}{\epsilon} \vec D \right) = -\left(\frac{\chi_e}{1+\chi_e}\right)\rho_f $$
      </p>
      <p>
        The first equation above is because of the definition of the bound charge.  The second is due to linearity.  The third is the theorem we found at the end of the discussion of unit polarization.
      </p>
      <p>
        We earlier saw that \(D^\perp_{above}-D^{\perp}_{below} = \sigma_f\) which tells us that

        $$\epsilon_{above}E^{\perp}_{above}-\epsilon_{below}E^{\perp} = \sigma_f$$
      </p>
      <p>
        We can rephrase this in terms of the potential

        $$\epsilon_{above}\frac{\partial V_{above}}{\partial n} - \epsilon_{below}\frac{\partial V_{below}}{\partial n} = -\sigma_{f}$$
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        But we know the potential is continuous so that \(V_{above}=V_{below}\).  <br><br>

        <b>What did we learn here?  The potential being continuous is really looking at two sides of a function at a corner.  The potential is, say, an increasing function just above the surface and decreasing just below.  So you expect the partial derivatives to not be equal, yet here there seems like an implied ellipsis suggesting that the partial derivatives are equal.</b>

    <h3>Example 7</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        A sphere of homogeneous linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise constant field.  Find the field inside the dielectric.
      </p>
      <div class="sol question">
        <p>
          We can view this as an instance of Laplace's equation with boundary conditions: <i>V</i> is continuous everywhere, \(\epsilon \frac{\partial V_{in}}{\partial r} = \epsilon_0\frac{\partial V_{out}}{\partial r}\), and \(V_{out} \rightarrow -E_0 r\cos\theta\) if <i>r</i> is large.  This last claim is due to the fact that, were you to bring in a charge from infinity, the only portion of the field that you would work against is the parallel component of the path.  So here \(\theta=0\) indicates a direction parallel to the constant electric field.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here we use some Legendre polynomial stuff I'd rather not chase down right now.

    <h3>Example 8</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Suppose the entire region below <i>z = 0</i> is filled with a uniform linear dielectric.  Calculate the force on a point charge <i>q</i> a distance above the origin.
      </p>
      <div class="sol question">
        <p>
          The surface bound charge will be opposite in sign to <i>q</i>.  So the force will be attractive.  There is no volumetric bound charge.  The surface bound charge formula we can write in terms of the field, because of linearity.

          $$ \sigma_b = \vec P\cdot \hat n = P_z = \epsilon_0 \chi_e E_z $$

          <b>To be clear about the above, \(E_z\) is the strength of the electric field at the point of the charged particle yes?  So at that point the charged particle does not exert any force, because things don't exert forces on themselves? So when we calculate the force due to the charged particle we are only using this in order to then apply Newton's third law?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to find the force of the dielectric acting at <i>q</i> but it's easier to find the force <i>q</i> exerts on each point of the bound charge and then by Newton's third law this is the opposite force that the point exerts on <i>q</i>.  Coulomb's law solves this part.
