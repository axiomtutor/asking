    <h1>1.0 Electrostatics: charges and fields</h1>
    Two important features of charges are <i>conservation</i> and <i>quantization</i>.  The electric force between two charges is given by <i>Coulomb's law</i>, which tells us the force is proportionate to \(1/r^2\).  The force law is conservative in the sense of path independence, so we can talk about potential energy.  A useful concept is the <i>electric field</i> which is <i>force per unit charge at each point in space.</i> The <i>flux</i> of the field through a surface is defined in this chapter, and leads to <i>Gauss's law</i>. Finally we discuss <i>energy density</i>.
