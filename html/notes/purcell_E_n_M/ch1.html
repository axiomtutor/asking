    <h1>1.0 Electrostatics: charges and fields</h1>
    Two important features of charges are <i>conservation</i> and <i>quantization</i>.  The electric force between two charges is given by <i>Coulomb's law</i>, which tells us the force is proportionate to \(1/r^2\).  The force law is conservative in the sense of path independence, so we can talk about potential energy.  A useful concept is the <i>electric field</i> which is <i>force per unit charge at each point in space.</i> The <i>flux</i> of the field through a surface is defined in this chapter, and leads to <i>Gauss's law</i>. Finally we discuss <i>energy density</i>.

    <h2>1.1 Electric charge</h2>

    <h2>1.2 Conservation of charge</h2>

    <h2>1.3 Quantization of charge</h2>

    <h2>1.4 Coulomb's Law</h2>
    <p>
      $$\vec{F}_2 = k\frac{q_1q_2\hat{r}_{21}}{r^2}$$

      where

      <ul>
        <li>\(\vec{F}_2\) is the force acting on charge 2</li>
        <li>\(\hat{r}_{21}\) is the unit vector from 1 to 2</li>
        <li>\(r\) is the distance from 1 to 2</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We also call \(\epsilon_0\) the <i>permitivity of free space</i> and $$k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$
    </p>

    In the SI unit system <i>k</i> has units \(Nm^2C^{-2}\). The <i>N</i> is the symbol for a Newton of force, <i>m</i> for meter.  We will take <i>C</i> to be the Coulomb, our unit of electrical "charge" analogous to how mass is our unit of gravitational "charge".<br><br>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        Note that we can infer nothing about the Coulomb unit from just this.  By dimensional analysis of Coulomb's law

        $$[N]=[Nm^2C\ ^{-2}][C\ ^2m^{-2}]$$

      which simplifies to a trivial equality.  The units of <i>k</i> are simply a re-statement of what dimensional analysis would tell us is required given the quantities involved.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The <i>Gaussian</i> system is one of several that uses cgs (centimeters, grams, seconds).  In it <i>k</i> is exactly 1, dimensionless, where \(\vec{F}\) measured in <i>dynes</i> and <i>q</i> in <i>esu</i>.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>
        Note that we can already relate dynes to Newtons.

        $$N = \frac{kg\cdot m}{s^2} = \frac{10^3g\cdot 100cm}{s^2}$$
        $$=\ 10^5dyne$$
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <p>
        <b>Example (relate Coulombs and esu)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the relationship between Coulombs and <i>esu</i>s?  A good start is to pick some simple numbers using each unit.  If you have two 1 <i>C</i> charges 1 <i>m</i> apart Coulomb's law implies the force magnitude is

        $$F[N] = kN \approx 9 \times 10^9N$$
        $$=9\times 10^{14}dyne$$
      </p>

      <p>
        To do it again in the Gaussian system

        $$F[dyne] = q_1[esu]q_2[esu]/(100cm)^2 = q^2esu^2/(10^4cm^2)$$
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we are taking \( q[esu] = 1C\) then effectively <i>q</i> is the coefficient of proportionality, and therefore the thing we want to solve for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we already know the force measure in dynes we can say

        $$9\times 10^{14} dyne = q^2esu^2/(10^4cm^2)$$

        and since the units must cancel, we focus on the numbers which tell us

        $$q^2 = 9\times 10^{18} \Rightarrow q = 3\times 10^9$$
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Forces are additive which we call the principle of <i>superposition</i>.
    </p>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        The book makes mention of some experiements and inferences, but these aren't clear to me.  Should I concern myself with them?
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.5 Energy of a system of charges</h2>
    <p>
      We can define work by

      $$W = \int (applied force)\cdot(displacement)$$
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <b>Example (bring together particles)</b> <br><br>
      <p>
        Suppose we bring charges \(q_1,q_2\) within a distance <i>r</i> of each other.  Then the work done is

        $$\int_\infty^r (-kq_1q_2/r^2)dr$$
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is the work done to assemble the arrangement and it is also the <i>potential energy</i> stored in the system.  The potential energy of a system can be shown to be

      $$U = \frac{1}{2}\sum\sum_{i\ne j} k\frac{q_iq_j}{r_{ij}}$$

      where it is worth emphasizing the lack of a minus, or a square on the distance.
    </p>
    <h2>1.6 Electrical energy in a crystal lattice</h2>
    <p>
      Salt crystals are lattices of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>.  We want to know the potential energy per unit volume or mass.  We may start with a single positive ion, consider the energy required to bring in all the others around just it, then simply repeat taking each other particle as the center.  Since every pair is double-counted in the process, we divide by 2.  Since the calculation per ion will be identical, we may instead multiply by <i>N</i>.  An expression for the total potential energy is

      $$U = \frac{N}{2}\sum_{k=2}^N kq_1q_k/r_{1k}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      We can group elements by equal radii.  If we diagram the point particles by <br>

      <canvas id="crystal" width="150" height="150"></canvas> <br>

      then the faces of the cube contain the nearest points.  Say they are of radius <i>r</i>, of which there are six equivalent particles.  The corners of the cube contain eight equivalent points of radius \(\sqrt{3}r\).  As we expand out, the <i>i</i>th shell will be a distance of \(\sqrt{i+1}r\) away from the center.  We can infer that the potential energy is

      $$\frac{Nk}{2}\left(\frac{-6e^2}{r} + \frac{8e^2}{\sqrt{2}r} - \frac{6e^2}{\sqrt{3}r}+...\right)$$
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact value of this is not easy to obtain, but the only important feature is that it's negative.  This indicates that work must be <i>done</i> to disassemble the arrangement, i.e. it's sticky.  Contrast this with bringing positive particles together:  The potential energy is positive.  Merely letting go of them after arranging them, will send them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since objects seek low-energy states, this would imply that the particles would collapse into each other to reduce <i>r</i> and thereby send <i>U</i> to \(-\infty\).  Quantum physics gives the answer to why this doesn't happen.  Even without quantum physics, this computed quantity of <i>U</i> is meaningful, which we will see later.
    </p>

    <h2>1.7 The electric field</h2>

    <p>
      We may generalize Coulomb's law into an expression for the force exerted by a system at each point in space, were a "test charge" placed at the point.  If we call this test charge <i>q</i> then it is a factor of each. term in the superposition expression.  <i>q</i> can therefore be factored out.  From this we define the electric field \( \vec{E}(p) \) at a point <i>p</i> in space by

      $$\vec{F}(p) = q\vec{E}(p)$$
    </p>
    <p>
      By dimensional analysis we can say that the units of the electric field are N/C.
    </p>
    <h2>1.8 Charge distributions</h2>
    <p>
      We can also generalize to charge distributions, \( \rho(p) \) and then

      $$\vec{E}(p) = k\int \frac{\rho(p)\hat{r}}{r^2}dV$$
    </p>
    <div class="question">
      <b>Example (Field due to a hemisphere)</b>
      <p>How do I do this integral and complete this example?</p>
      <p>
        Suppose a solid hemisphere has radius <i>R</i> and uniform charge density \(\rho\).  What is the electric field at the center?
      </p>
      <p>
        The radius is the constant <i>R</i>, and the charge density \(\rho\) is constant, so

        $$ E(p) = k\rho\iiint_V \frac{\hat{r}}{r^2} \cdot dV $$
      </p>
      <p>
        To integrate over the region we need to parameterize it.  The most natural parameterization is spherical.  First let's agree on a coordinate system, using that which you find in mathematics.  Here <i>x, y, z</i> are used for rectangular coordinates.  Physics does the same but the labels are on different axes.  In Math, <i>x</i> controls the forward-backward axis (the "perspective axis"). <i>y</i> controls the left-right axis.  <i>z</i> controls the up-down axis.  
        
        <canvas id="coordinates" width=150 height=150></canvas>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the diagram the text labels are on the positive end of the axis.  So the positive <i>y</i> values are to the right, the positive <i>z</i> values are up.  Importantly, the positive <i>x</i> direction is toward the viewer, which is labeled on the lower-left-hand portion of the diagram. This choice satisfies the so-called "right-hand rule" whereby you use your right hand to do the following:  Point your index finger toward the positive <i>x</i> axis.  Now stick your middle finger out at a 90-degree angle from your palm.  Now point that middle finger toward the positive <i>y</i> direction.  Now point your thumb up.  Your thumb should point straight up in the direction of the positive <i>z</i> axis.  We could have re-labeled the axes but whatever the re-labeling is, it must satisfy the right-hand rule.  So although there are \(6\cdot 4\cdot 2\) possible axis labelings, only half of these satisfy the right-hand rule and are permissible.  Physicists use <i>x</i> to control the left-right, <i>y</i> to control the up-down, and <i>z</i> controls the perspective axis with the positive direction toward the viewer.  This system also satisfies the right-hand rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        In mathematics we use \(\rho,\theta,\phi \) to specify a point in the space spherically.  The physicist's use of \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) is the reverse of their roles for mathematicians, and the physicist uses \(\rho\) for density and therefore uses something else like <i>r</i> or some other not-yet-reserved symbol for radius.  For mathematicians \(\theta\) controls the rotation through the the <i>x-y</i> plane.  Note that we only need the angles between 0 and \(2\pi\); more values are possible but redundant.  \(\phi\) controls a rotation which starts at the top of the <i>z</i> axis and rotates down.  Note that to uniquely identify a point anywhere in space, we only need the angles between 0 and \(\pi\).  Allowing values between 0 and \(2\pi\) is already redundant because points beyond \(\pi\) could be captured by moving \(\theta\) by a half-rotation around its axis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should note that to integerate in spherical coordinates, we need a special expression for a volume element.  Rather than \(dx\ dy\ dz\) representing an infinitesimal volume element in rectangular coordinates, we use \( \rho^2\sin\phi\ d\rho\ d\phi\ d\theta\).  As you can see this involves multiplying by values, \(\rho^2\sin\phi\), due to the transformation of coordinates.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to get back to the problem, we integrate 
        
        $$E(p) = k\rho\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{\pi/2}^\pi\int_0^R \frac{\hat{r}}{r^2}r^2\sin\phi\ dr\ d\phi\ d\theta$$
        
        where we choose <i>r</i> for the variable radius because \(\rho\) and <i>R</i> are already reserved for density and the fixed radius.
        The outer integral encodes a full rotation, the middle integral starts at the angle \(\pi\) rather than 0 because it is a hemisphere.  The radius parameter ranges out to the radius of the hemisphere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.9 Flux</h2>
    <p>
      In the previous section we imagined that we knew the charges and infered the electric field from it.  Suppose now that we already know the electric field <i>E(p)</i> and wish to learn about the charges which generate the field.  To do so we consider a closed surface in space.  Any point on this surface, because it is in the electric field, has a force vector pointing in some direction.  The component of that vector pointing normal to the surface is the amount of force exerted on the surface element.  If we aggregate all of these values, we define the quantity as <i>flux</i>.
      
      $$ \text{flux} = \Phi = \int_S \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that flux can be defined for any vector field.  Not only does it generalize from electricity to other forces, but it also generalizes to vector fields that do not model force at all.  For instance we could take the velocity vector field for a stream of water, and the flux would measure the rate at which water flows through a membrane.  
    </p>
    <h2>1.10 Gauss's law</h2>
    <p>
      To deliver on the promise that studying flux would help us learn about the charges given information about the electric field:  Gauss's law is that 
      $$ \Phi = E\cdot \text{ area } = \frac{q}{kr^2} \cdot A $$
      from which it is easy to solve for <i>q</i> the enclosed charge.
