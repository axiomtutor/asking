    <h1>2.0 The electric potential</h1>
    The first half discusses the potential of an electric field, the second discusses relevant mathematics.  The <i>potential difference</i> between two points is defined as the negative of the line integral.  Equivalently the field is the negative gradient of potential.  The potential is the potential energy per unit charge.  An important charge distribution giving rise to a frequently important potential is the <i>dipole</i> which consists of two equal and opposite charges.  
    <h1>2.1 Line integral of the electric field</h1>
    <p>
      The line integral is defined as the limit of the sum of the dot-product of the field and a secant vector.  An important theorem is that the line integral around any closed path in an electrostatic field is zero.

    <h1>2.2 Potential difference and the potential function</h1>
    <p>
      For any points <i>P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub></i> the potential function 
      
      $$\phi_{21} = -\int_{P_1}^{P_2}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s}$$
      
      is independent of path and represents the work done moving a positive charge from <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>.
