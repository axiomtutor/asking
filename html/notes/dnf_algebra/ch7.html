      <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
      <h1>Rings</h1>

      <h2>7.1 Basics</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>ring</b> is an abelian group with a * operation that distributes on the left and right.  We call the ring commutative if the * operation is.  We say it has a unitary element, 1, if it is an identity for *.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is interesting to note that a ring wouldn't make sense if + were not abelian, due to the requirement for distributivity.  In particular <i>(1+1)(a+b)=a+b+a+b=a+a+b+b</i> which requires <i>a+b=b+a</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring is called a <b>division ring</b> if every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.  If a division ring is commutative we call it a <b>field</b>.
      </p>
          <h4>Theorem: <i>0a = a0 = 0</i>, and <i>(-a)b=a(-b)=-ab</i>, and <i>(-a)(-b)=ab</i>, and if the ring has unity, <i>-a=-1a</i>.</h4>
          <div class="sol">
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i>
            <p>
              These follow from tricky uses of the additive subgroup together with distribution.  <i>0a = (0+0)a = 0a+0a</i> so now cancel.  For the next one <i>(-a)b+ab = (-a+a)b = 0b = 0</i> making <i>ab</i> the inverse of <i>(-a)b</i>.  For the next <i>(-a)(-b)-ab = (-a)(-b)+(-a)b = -a(-b+b) = -a0 = 0</i>.  Finally, <i>(-1)a = -(1a)=-a</i>.
            </p>
          </div>
      <p>
        A non-zero element is called a <b>zero divisor</b> if there is some non-zero element it multiplies with to zero.  It is a <b>unit</b> if it has a multiplicative inverse.  Clearly a unit cannot be a zero-divisor since, if <i>u</i> is a unit, then <i>ux = 0</i> implies <i>x = 0</i> by multiplying by the inverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can talk about the group under multiplication, if we only consider the units.  This is called the <b>group of units</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commutative ring with unit \(1\ne 0\) is called an <b>integral domain</b> if there are no zero divisors.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: If <i>a</i> is not a zero divisor then <i>ab=ac</i> implies either <i>a=0</i> or <i>b=c</i> (a weakened cancellation property, making not use of an inverse).</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Move to one side, factor, use the not-zero-divisor property.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Corollary: A finite integral domain is a field.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> because we have the cancellation law above, the map \( x\mapsto ax \) is injective for any <i>a</i>.  Hence it is a bijection and therefore sends some <i>x</i> to 1.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <b>subring</b> is a subgroup closed under multiplication.
      </p>
      <div class="ex">
        <p>
          A very important example is \( \mathbb Z[\sqrt D] \) where <i>D</i> is a square-free integer.  We typically use the <b>field norm</b> \(N(a+b\sqrt D)=|a^2-Db^2|\) because it is multiplicative, i.e. \(N(\alpha\beta)=N(\alpha)N(\beta), and because an element is a unit if and only if \(N(\alpha)=1\).
        </p>
