      <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
      <h1>Rings</h1>

      <h2>Section 7.1</h2>
      <h2>Basics</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>ring</b> is an abelian group with a * operation that distributes on the left and right.  We call the ring commutative if the * operation is.  We say it has a unitary element, 1, if it is an identity for *.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is interesting to note that a ring wouldn't make sense if + were not abelian, due to the requirement for distributivity.  In particular <i>(1+1)(a+b)=a+b+a+b=a+a+b+b</i> which requires <i>a+b=b+a</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring is called a <b>division ring</b> if every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.  If a division ring is commutative we call it a <b>field</b>.
      </p>
          <h4>Theorem: <i>0a = a0 = 0</i>, and <i>(-a)b=a(-b)=-ab</i>, and <i>(-a)(-b)=ab</i>, and if the ring has unity, <i>-a=-1a</i>.</h4>
          <div class="sol">
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i>
            <p>
              These follow from tricky uses of the additive subgroup together with distribution.  <i>0a = (0+0)a = 0a+0a</i> so now cancel.  For the next one <i>(-a)b+ab = (-a+a)b = 0b = 0</i> making <i>ab</i> the inverse of <i>(-a)b</i>.  For the next <i>(-a)(-b)-ab = (-a)(-b)+(-a)b = -a(-b+b) = -a0 = 0</i>.  Finally, <i>(-1)a = -(1a)=-a</i>.
            </p>
          </div>
      <p>
        A non-zero element is called a <b>zero divisor</b> if there is some non-zero element it multiplies with to zero.  It is a <b>unit</b> if it has a multiplicative inverse.  Clearly a unit cannot be a zero-divisor since, if <i>u</i> is a unit, then <i>ux = 0</i> implies <i>x = 0</i> by multiplying by the inverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can talk about the group under multiplication, if we only consider the units.  This is called the <b>group of units</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commutative ring with unit \(1\ne 0\) is called an <b>integral domain</b> if there are no zero divisors.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: If <i>a</i> is not a zero divisor then <i>ab=ac</i> implies either <i>a=0</i> or <i>b=c</i> (a weakened cancellation property, making not use of an inverse).</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Move to one side, factor, use the not-zero-divisor property.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Corollary: A finite integral domain is a field.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> because we have the cancellation law above, the map \( x\mapsto ax \) is injective for any <i>a</i>.  Hence it is a bijection and therefore sends some <i>x</i> to 1.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A <b>subring</b> is a subgroup closed under multiplication.
      </p>
      <div class="ex">
        <p>
          A very important example is \( \mathbb Z[\sqrt D] \) where <i>D</i> is a square-free integer.  We typically use the <b>field norm</b> \(N(a+b\sqrt D)=|a^2-Db^2|\) because it is multiplicative, i.e. \(N(\alpha\beta)=N(\alpha)N(\beta)\), and because an element is a unit if and only if \(N(\alpha)=1\).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 7.2</h2>
    <h2>Polynomial Rings, Matrix Rings, Group Rings</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        In the example of polynomials we assume a commutative ring with identity for our coefficients.  Then the <b>ring of polynomials with coefficients in a ring</b>, <i>R[x]</i>, is a ring.  Addition is defined in the obvious way, coordinate-wise.  Multiplication is defined in the usual way, convoluting the terms.  That is to say the coefficient of the <i>x<sup>k</sup></i> is \(\sum_{i=0}^k a_ib_{k-i}\).  The degree is the largest power of a monomial with non-zero coefficient.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: The degree of a product is the sum of degrees, if both polynomials are not zero.  The only units are the constants which are also units in <i>R</i>.  <i>R[x]</i> is an integral domain.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> The degree claim is clear from the formula for the coefficients of a product.  The fact that units in <i>R</i> are units in <i>R[x]</i> is even clearer, but what is challenging is to know that no non-constant polynomial is a unit.  But of course, the degree fact just proved makes the demonstration easy.  Finally we want to see that there are no zero-divisors, but again the degree formula makes this easy.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Next we define a <b>matrix ring</b> with coordinates in <i>R</i>.  These are \(n\times n\) matrices with addition and multiplication defined in the obvious ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally we define <b>group rings</b> for an arbitrary commutative ring <i>R</i> with identity \(1\ne 0\) and an arbitrary group <i>G</i>.  Then the group ring <i>RG</i> is the set of all formal sums

        $$\sum a_ig_i \quad a_i\in R $$

        with addition and multiplication defined in the usual way.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 7.3</h2>
    <h2>Ring Homomorphisms and Quotient Rings</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>homomorphism</b> is defined as you'd expect, just as with <b>kernel</b>.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: Kernels and images of ring homomorphisms are subrings.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> The proof is straight-forward just as in the case of groups.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Naturally we want an analogue to normal subgroups for rings, in order to both understand kernels of homomorphisms as well as to define a quotient ring.  We call such a set an <b>ideal</b>, and we understand each coset to be represented under addition.  That is to say, if <i>I</i> is an ideal and <i>r</i> any ring element, then the coset corresponding to <i>r</i> is <i>r+I</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the analogy with groups breaks down, since ideals will ned to have a property unlike any property of normal subgroups.  Notice that in order for the ring multiplication to be define we will require that, for any ideal <i>I</i>, and any two <i>&alpha; &ne; &beta; &in; I</i>, the choice of different representatives shouldn't matter.  In particular, this implies that for any two <i>r, s &in; R</i>,

        $$ (r+\alpha+I)(s+\beta+I) = rs + I $$
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we can extract some requirements on how <i>I</i> interacts with ring elements.  In particular if <i>s = 0</i> then <i>r&beta;+&alpha;&beta;</i> must be an element of <i>I</i>.  But of course we will require <i>I</i> to be a subring, so <i>&alpha;&beta;</i> is already in <i>I</i>.  So <i>r&beta;</i> is in <i>I</i>.  But this means that <i>I</i> must be closed under <i>arbitrary</i> products and not just closed under products within <i>I</i> alone.  That is to say, <i>rI = I</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For non-commutative rings we can distinguish <b>left-ideals</b> and <b>right-ideals</b>, and <b>two-sided ideals</b>.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: The first four isomorphism theorems hold for rings.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> The proof is effectively the same as for groups.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 7.4 </h2>
    <h2>Properties of Ideals</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Throughout this section we assume <i>R</i> is a ring with identity 1 &ne; 0.  The definition of the <b>ideal generated by <i>A</i></b> is as you'd expect.  A <b>principal ideal</b> is an ideal generated by just one element.  A <b>finitely generated ideal</b> is what you'd expect.  It is worth noting that an ideal generated by a single element, <i>a</i>, that is to say the ideal <i>(a)</i>, is equal to all of the <i>R</i>-multiples of <i>a</i>.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: An ideal equals the ring if and only if the ideal contains a unit.  If <i>R</i> is commutative then it's a field if and only if the only ideals are "stupid".</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> I call something "stupid" if it's unofficially trivial.  In this case the ring of just the 0 element, and the entire ring, are stupid ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the section assumes the ring has the unitary element, then if <i>I=R</i> then <i>1 &in; I</i>.  Conversely if <i>u &in; I</i> is a unit then <i>u<sup>-1</sup>u = 1 &in; I</i>, and since <i>1 &in; I</i> then for any <i>r &in; R</i> we have <i>rI = I</i> so <i>r &in; I</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second claim is an immediate corollary since fields have only 0 and units, and are commutative.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Corollary: Any nonzero ring homomorphism from a field to a ring is an injection.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> The kernel of the homomorphism is an ideal and in order to not be <i>R</i>, it must be 0.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        An ideal is <b>maximal</b> if there is no ideal between it and the whole ring.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: Every proper ideal is contained in some maximal ideal.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i>  The proof fundamentally rests on Zorn's Lemma, which I'm going to just accept at the same time as I accept this theorem without proof.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Theorem: For commuatitive rings with identity, an ideal is maximal if and only if the quotient ring is a field.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> If the ring is <i>R</i> and the maximal ideal is <i>M</i> then we use the fact that <i>R/M</i> is a field if and only if its only ideals are stupid.  Because <i>M</i> is maximal there is nothing between it and <i>R</i>.  Now by the Fourth Isomorphism Theorem (the "lattice" isomorphism theorem), the ideals containing <i>M</i> are in a bijection with all the ideals of <i>R/M</i>.  Since the ideals containing <i>M</i> can only be <i>M</i> and <i>R</i>, we're done.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        An ideal <i>P</i> is called a <b>prime ideal</b> if <i>P &ne; R</i> and whenever <i>ab &in; P</i> then at least one of <i>a, b</i> are in <i>P</i>.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: The prime ideals of &Zopf; are the ideals <i>p&Zopf;</i> where <i>p</i> is prime, and the 0 ideal.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> First note that since any ideal is a subring, then any ideal is of the form <i>n&Zopf;</i>.  It's easy to check that any such set is an ideal.  Now if <i>a, b &in; R</i> and <i>ab &in; p&Zopf;</i>, then <i>ab = pk</i> for some <i>k &in; &Zopf;</i>.  Then <i>p | ab</i> and so by some basic number theory <i>p | a</i> or <i>p | b</i>.  Whichever it is, the corresponding element is in <i>p&Zopf;</i>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Theorem: For commutative rings, an ideal is prime if and only if the quotient is an integral domain.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Translate the property of a prime ideal over to a property of the elements in the quotient, using "if and only if" at each step.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Theorem: For commutative rings, maximal ideals are always prime.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> All fields are integral domains.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 7.5</h2>
    <h2>Rings of Fractions</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        This chapter is neat, but I'm not sure the details will matter for me right now.  So for now I skip it, just noting that the basic result is interesting: Every integral domain can be embedded in a smallest field by constructing the ring of fractions from it.  In particular the smallest field containing the integers is the rationals.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 7.6</h2>
    <h2>The Chinese Remainder Theorem</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        We again take all of the rings in this section to be commutative with identity 1 &ne; 0.  We define the <b>ring direct product</b> of two rings to be the ring of tuples where both addition and multiplication are defined coordinate-wise.  We say that ideals <i>A, B &subseteq; R</i> are <b>comaximal</b> if <i>A+B = R</i>.  If <i>A = (a), B = (b)</i> then <i>AB = (ab)</i>, which can be generalized in a few ways.
      </p>
      <h4>The Chinese Remainder Theorem: Let <i>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>k</sub></i> be ideals in <i>R</i>.  The map <i>R &rightarrow; R/A<sub>1</sub> &times; R/A<sub>2</sub> &times; ... &times; R/A<sub>k</sub></i> defined by <i>r &mapsto; (r+A<sub>1</sub>, r+A<sub>2</sub>, ..., r+A<sub>k</sub>)</i> is a ring homomorphism with kernel <i>&bigcap;A<sub>i</sub></i>.  If all of the distinct <i>i &ne; j</i> correspond to comaximal <i>A<sub>i</sub>, A<sub>j</sub></i>, then the map is surjective and the kernel equals <i>&prod;A<sub>i</sub></i>.</h4>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> We prove the case for <i>k = 2</i> and every other case follows from a simple inductive argument.  Since the map is just the natural projection onto the quotient groups, it is clearly a homomorphism.  Any element is in the kernel if and only if it's in both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now assume that <i>A, B</i> are comaximal and let <i>a &in; A, b &in; B</i> such that <i>a+b = 1</i>.  Then <i>&phi;(a) = (0,1), &phi;(b) = (1,0)</i>.  We now show that <i>&phi;</i> is surjective by considering an arbitrary <i>(r+A, s+B)</i>.  Then <i>&phi;(as+br) = (r+A, s+B)</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally we show that <i>A&cap;B = AB</i>.  It is always true that <i>AB &subseteq; A&cap;B</i>.  Now let <i>c &in; A&cap;B</i> and using the same <i>a+b = 1</i> as above it follows that <i>c = ca+cb &in; AB</i>.  Note that the inclusion holds because the product of rings is defined by containing all sums of all products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The familiar version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem comes from first proving <i>&Zopf;/mn&Zopf; &cong; (&Zopf;/m&Zopf;)&times;(&Zopf;/n&Zopf;)</i>, then using the above theorem to infer that the isomorphism still holds for the corresponding groups of units.
        </p>
