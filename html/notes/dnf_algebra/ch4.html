      <h1>Group Actions</h1>

      <h2>4.1 Group Actions and Permutation Representations</h2>
    <div>

          <h4>Theorem: There is a bijection between group actions and the homomorphisms into the symmetric group.</h4>
          <p class="sol">
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i> For any action, you can define a permutation.  It is easy to show this action is injective.  To show that it's surjective note that for any homomorphism, you can build an action based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will call a <b>permutation representation</b> any homomorphism from a group into any symmetric group.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            For a group <i>G</i> acting on set <i>A</i> we define the <b>orbit</b> of an element \(a\in A\) to be the set of all \(b\in A\) such that \(a\sim b\) where this means that there exists some \(g\in G\) such that \(a = g\cdot b\).
          </p>
          <h4>Theorem: Orbits partition the <i>G</i>-set into sets of size the index of the stabilizer.  </h4>
          <div class="sol">
            <p>
              <i>Explanation: </i> It's very straight-forward to show the relation is an equivalence relation.  So the interesting task is to show that the orbit of an element <i>a</i> has size \(|G:G_a|\).  The intuition is the same as for Lagrange's Theorem.  In that theorem you imagine a subgroup <i>H</i>, and then imagine multiplying it by any element.  You get a coset <i>xH</i> and only one of the following two is possible: <i>H = xH</i> or \(H\cap xH = \emptyset\).  So all these cosets partition and have the same size, so the size of the subgroup is |<i>G</i>| over the number of cosets.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case we have orbits and the stabilizer group. We want to identify each coset of \(G_a\) with some element of the orbit \(\mathcal O_a\).  So we set up the bijection \(\varphi:\mathcal O_a \rightarrow \{xG_a:x\in G\}\) defined on any \(x\in\mathcal O_a\) in the following way.  Let \(g\in G\) such that \(g\cdot x = a\).  Then \(\varphi(x) = gG_a\).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is injective since, for any two \(x,y\in G_a\) such that \(g_1\cdot x = g_2\cdot y = a\) then \(\varphi(x)=\varphi(y) = g_1G_a = g_2G_a\) entials that \(g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_a\).  So \( g_2^{-1}g_1\cdot a = a \) and so \(g_1\cdot a = g_2\cdot a = x = y\).  Why is the map surjective? If \(gG_a\) is any coset, we need to find an \(x\in \mathcal O_a\) such that \(g\cdot x = a\).  This is the same as \(x=g^{-1}\cdot a\) and so we've found <i>x</i>.

    <h3>Cycle Decompositions</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <h4>Theorem: Every element of the symmetric group has a unique cycle decomposition.</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Take any \(\sigma \in S_n\) and consider the subgroup it generates, call it \(G = \langle \sigma \rangle\). Also consider how <i>G</i> acts on <i>A = {1, 2, ..., n}</i>.  From the above, <i>A</i> is partitioned into orbits of the elements of <i>G</i>.  Those orbits make up the cycles, which we know since <i>G</i> is cyclic and it's not hard to prove that inside each cycle we can get from any element to another with a sufficient power of \(\sigma\).  This shows that \(\sigma\) has a cycle decomposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that it's unique, note that in any orbit the order of the elements is determined by the powers of \(\sigma\) up to the choice of the first element (i.e. the orbit representative).  Any other rearrangement comes from the order in which the orbits are considered.  But the orbits themselves, and the sequence in which elements are visited within each, is unique and hence so are the cycles and the order in which their elements appear.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 4.2</h2>
    <h2>Cayley's Theorem--Groups Acting on Themselves</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        We can view any given element of a group as acting on the group by multiplication. We will later see that this action is both transitive and faithful, and the stabilizer of any point is always just the identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way it is even more interesting to act on cosets.  Note that when the subgroup is just the identity then the cosets are just the individual elements of the group.  So in this case we might as well act on the group (as we described it in the previous paragraph).
      </p>
      <p>
        If \(H \leq G\) then we homomorphically map <i>G</i> into a symmetric group.  In particular if there are <i>n</i> cosets of <i>H</i> (i.e. if <i>|G:H| = n</i>) then we map into \(S_n\).  The map is defined by \(g \mapsto \sigma_g\) where \(\sigma_g\) sends <i>i</i> to <i>j</i> if <i>g</i> sends the coset indexed by <i>i</i> to the coset indexed by <i>j</i>.  If this homomorphism from <i>G</i> to \(S_n\) is called \(\pi_H\) then we call this the <b>permutation representation</b> associated with <i>H</i>.  (The system of indexing is unimportant.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: A group acting on cosets of a subgroup acts transitively.  The stabilizer of the subgroup is just itself.  The kernel of the action is the intersection of all conjugations of the subgroup.  The kernel of the permutation representation homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup that is still contained in our first subgroup. </h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> To show the action is transitive we need to see that you can "get from any coset to another by multiplication".  Of course to get from <i>aH</i> to <i>bH</i> you can multiply by \(ba^{-a}\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The kernel of the action is the set of all group elements which fix all G-set elements.
