          <h4>Theorem: There is a bijection between group actions and the homomorphisms into the symmetric group.</h4>
          <p class="sol">
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i> For any action, you can define a permutation.  It is easy to show this action is injective.  To show that it's surjective note that for any homomorphism, you can build an action based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will call a <b>permutation representation</b> any homomorphism from a group into any symmetric group.

            For a group <i>G</i> acting on set <i>A</i> we define the <b>orbit</b> of an element \(a\in A\) to be the set of all \(b\in A\) such that \(a\sim b\) where this means that there exists some \(g\in G\) such that \(a = g\cdot b\).
          </p>
          <h4>Theorem: Orbits partition the <i>G</i>-set into sets of size the index of the stabilizer.  </h4>
          <div class="sol">
            <p>
              <i>Explanation: </i> It's very straight-forward to show the relation is an equivalence relation.  So the interesting task is to show that the orbit of an element <i>a</i> has size \(|G:G_a|\).  The intuition is the same as for Lagrange's Theorem.  In that theorem you imagine a subgroup <i>H</i>, and then imagine multiplying it by any element.  You get a coset <i>xH</i> and only one of the following two is possible: <i>H = xH</i> or \(H\cap xH = \emptyset\).  So all these cosets partition and have the same size, so the size of the subgroup is |<i>G</i>| over the number of cosets.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case we have orbits and the stabilizer group. We want to identify each coset of \(G_a\) with some element of the orbit \(\mathcal O_a\).  So we set up the bijection \(\varphi:\mathcal O_a \rightarrow \{xG_a:x\in G\}\) defined on any \(x\in\mathcal O_a\) in the following way.  Let \(g\in G\) such that \(g\cdot x = a\).  Then \(\varphi(x) = gG_a\).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is injective since, for any two \(x,y\in G_a\) such that \(g_1\cdot x = g_2\cdot y = a\) then \(\varphi(x)=\varphi(y) = g_1G_a = g_2G_a\) entials that \(g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_a\).  So \( y = g_2^{-1} \cdot a \)
