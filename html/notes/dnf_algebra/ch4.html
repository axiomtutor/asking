      <h2>4.1 Group Actions and Permutation Representations</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <div>
          <h4>Theorem: There is a bijection between group actions and the homomorphisms into the symmetric group.</h4>
          <p class="sol">
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i> For any action, you can define a permutation.  It is easy to show this action is injective.  To show that it's surjective note that for any homomorphism, you can build an action based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will call a <b>permutation representation</b> any homomorphism from a group into any symmetric group.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            For a group <i>G</i> acting on set <i>A</i> we define the <b>orbit</b> of an element \(a\in A\) to be the set of all \(b\in A\) such that \(a\sim b\) where this means that there exists some \(g\in G\) such that \(a = g\cdot b\).
          </p>
          <h4>Theorem: Orbits partition the <i>G</i>-set into sets of size the index of the stabilizer.  </h4>
          <div class="sol">
            <p>
              <i>Explanation: </i> It's very straight-forward to show the relation is an equivalence relation.  So the interesting task is to show that the orbit of an element <i>a</i> has size \(|G:G_a|\).  The intuition is the same as for Lagrange's Theorem.  In that theorem you imagine a subgroup <i>H</i>, and then imagine multiplying it by any element.  You get a coset <i>xH</i> and only one of the following two is possible: <i>H = xH</i> or \(H\cap xH = \emptyset\).  So all these cosets partition and have the same size, so the size of the subgroup is |<i>G</i>| over the number of cosets.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case we have orbits and the stabilizer group. We want to identify each coset of \(G_a\) with some element of the orbit \(\mathcal O_a\).  So we set up the bijection \(\varphi:\mathcal O_a \rightarrow \{xG_a:x\in G\}\) defined on any \(x\in\mathcal O_a\) in the following way.  Let \(g\in G\) such that \(g\cdot x = a\).  Then \(\varphi(x) = gG_a\).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is injective since, for any two \(x,y\in G_a\) such that \(g_1\cdot x = g_2\cdot y = a\) then \(\varphi(x)=\varphi(y) = g_1G_a = g_2G_a\) entials that \(g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_a\).  So \( g_2^{-1}g_1\cdot a = a \) and so \(g_1\cdot a = g_2\cdot a = x = y\).  Why is the map surjective? If \(gG_a\) is any coset, we need to find an \(x\in \mathcal O_a\) such that \(g\cdot x = a\).  This is the same as \(x=g^{-1}\cdot a\) and so we've found <i>x</i>.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

    </div>
    <h3>Cycle Decompositions</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <h4>Theorem: Every element of the symmetric group has a unique cycle decomposition.</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Take any \(\sigma \in S_n\) and consider the subgroup it generates, call it \(G = \langle \sigma \rangle\). Also consider how <i>G</i> acts on <i>A = {1, 2, ..., n}</i>.  From the above, <i>A</i> is partitioned into orbits of the elements of <i>G</i>.  Those orbits make up the cycles, which we know since <i>G</i> is cyclic and it's not hard to prove that inside each cycle we can get from any element to another with a sufficient power of \(\sigma\).  This shows that \(\sigma\) has a cycle decomposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that it's unique, note that in any orbit the order of the elements is determined by the powers of \(\sigma\) up to the choice of the first element (i.e. the orbit representative).  Any other rearrangement comes from the order in which the orbits are considered.  But the orbits themselves, and the sequence in which elements are visited within each, is unique and hence so are the cycles and the order in which their elements appear.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 4.2</h2>
    <h2>Cayley's Theorem--Groups Acting on Themselves</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        We can view any given element of a group as acting on the group by multiplication. We will later see that this action is both transitive and faithful, and the stabilizer of any point is always just the identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way it is even more interesting to act on cosets.  Note that when the subgroup is just the identity then the cosets are just the individual elements of the group.  So in this case we might as well act on the group (as we described it in the previous paragraph).
      </p>
      <p>
        If \(H \leq G\) then we homomorphically map <i>G</i> into a symmetric group.  In particular if there are <i>n</i> cosets of <i>H</i> (i.e. if <i>|G:H| = n</i>) then we map into \(S_n\).  The map is defined by \(g \mapsto \sigma_g\) where \(\sigma_g\) sends <i>i</i> to <i>j</i> if <i>g</i> sends the coset indexed by <i>i</i> to the coset indexed by <i>j</i>.  If this homomorphism from <i>G</i> to \(S_n\) is called \(\pi_H\) then we call this the <b>permutation representation</b> associated with <i>H</i>.  (The system of indexing is unimportant.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: A group acting on cosets of a subgroup acts transitively.  The stabilizer of the subgroup is just itself.  The kernel of the action is the intersection of all conjugations of the subgroup.  The kernel of the permutation representation homomorphism is the largest normal subgroup that is still contained in our first subgroup. </h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> To show the action is transitive we need to see that you can "get from any coset to another by multiplication".  Of course to get from <i>aH</i> to <i>bH</i> you can multiply by \(ba^{-1}\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The stabilizer of <i>H</i> is the set of all elements that fix <i>H</i>.  The previous chapter makes it pretty clear that everything in <i>H</i> fixes <i>H</i> and everything not in <i>H</i> doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kernel of the action is the set of all group elements that fix every G-set element.  That is to say, we need all elements that fix all cosets.

        $$ gxH = xH $$

        $$ x^{-1}gxH = H$$

        implies \(x^{-1}gx \in H\) and so \(g\in xHx^{-1}\).  We can turn this observation into a bi-directional proof to show that the sets are equal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, let \(\pi_H\) be the permutation representation associated with <i>H</i>.  Before anything else we should actually confirm that this is a homomorphism.  If \(a,b\in G\) then \(\varphi(ab) = \sigma_{ab}\).  The equality that we want to proof is an equality of the functions \(\sigma_{ab}=\sigma_a\sigma_b\) so we need to show that these map the same things to the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <i>iH</i> be the coset indexed <i>i</i>, and \(\sigma_b(i) = j\).  That means \(b\cdot iH = jH\).  Likewise let <i>kH</i> be the coset such that \(\sigma_a(j)=k\) so that \(a\cdot jH = kH\).

        $$ \sigma_{ab}(iH) = ab\cdot iH = a\cdot jH = kH $$
        $$ (\sigma_a\sigma_b)(iH) = \sigma_a(jH) = kH $$
      <p>
      </p>
        Moving on, we want to show that ker(\(\pi_H\)) is the largest normal subgroup of <i>G</i> such that \(ker(\pi_H)\leq H\).  We already know that the kernels of homomorphisms are normal.  Checking that ker(\(\pi_H\)) is in <i>H</i> is straight-forward.  This is the set of elements which map to the identity permutation.  That makes it the set of elements which fix all cosets (and so is the same as the set we discussed above).  Anything which fixes <i>H</i> in particular is in <i>H</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we want to show that any normal subgroup which is contained in <i>H</i> is contained in ker(\(\pi_H\)).  From the previous observation that \(\displaystyle ker(\pi_H) = \bigcap_{x\in G}xHx^{-1}\), together with the fact that normal subgroups are fixed under conjugation, this is immediate.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Cayley's Theorem: Every group is isomorphic to some symmetric group.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Apply the above to the subgroup of just the identity.  Since the kernel is the identity the map is injective.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: If any subgroup has index the smallest prime dividing the order of the group (for finite groups), then this subgroup must be normal.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> For the case when the prime is 2, the proof goes by directly thinking about the cosets.  One coset is the subgroup itself.  If you think of left and right cosets, they both share the subgroup as a coset.  Therefore everything that remains is also "the other coset".  Therefore all left cosets are the same right coset, and therefore the subgroup is normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more general group of order <i>|G:H| = p</i> the least prime dividing <i>|G|</i>, we know that this is homomorphic to a subgroup of \(S_p\).  In particular we'll try to see that ker(\(\pi_H)\) is just the identity, and we'll do this by scrutinizing its size.  Then we'll have that the homomorphism is an isomorphism with its image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now from a couple theorems ago that \(\ker \pi_H \leq H\leq G\).  And we know that all of these groups are finite, so <i>|G:H|=|G|/|H|</i> and \(|H:\ker \pi_H| = |H|/|\ker \pi_H|\) and \(|G:\ker \pi_H|=|G|/|\ker \pi_H|\).  So

        $$ |G:K| = |G:H||H:K| $$

        $$ |G:K| = pk $$

        where <i>k = |H:K|</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now since we're mapping <i>G</i> into \(S_p\) and since \(\ker \pi_H\trianglelefteq G\), then by the First Isomorphism Theorem \(G/\ker \pi_H\) is isomorphic to the image, which is a subgroup of \(S_p\).  So \(pk=|G/K|\) divides <i>p!</i> and so <i>k|(p-1)!</i>.  That shows that <i>k</i> must be made of factors that do not exceed <i>p-1</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now notice that <i>k | |G|</i> so if any prime divides <i>k</i> then it divides <i>|G|</i>.  So if we have any prime dividing <i>k</i> it must be greater than or equal to <i>p</i> (by the minimality of the choice of <i>p</i>).  So <i>k = 1</i>.
      </p>

    <h2>Section 4.3</h2>
    <h2>The Class Equation--Groups Acting on Themselves by Conjugation</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The orbits of the action of a group on itself by conjugation are called <b>conjugacy classes</b>.  Two elements in the same orbit are called <b>conjugates in <i>G</i></b>.  Just like last time we can generalize this notion to acting on cosets of a subgroup.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: The number of conjugates of any subset is the index of the normalizer.  The number of conjugates of any element is the index of the centralizer.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Note that, by a previous theorem, the size of an orbit is the index of the stabilizer.  But also the stabilizer when acting by conjugation is the normalizer.  Hence the number of conjugates of a subset is equal to the index of the normalizer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The claim for a single element is a consequence of the above when we take the set to be a singleton.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>The Class Equation: \(|G| = |Z(G)|+\sum |G:C_G(g)|\) where the sum is taken over representatives of distinct classes.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> The class equation is just a sum over all conjugacy classes.  The ones that are singletons are just elements in the center.  Everything else has the size that we discussed earlier, the index of the centralizer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: If a group has order the power of a prime, then it has a non-trivial center.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> In the class equation, the order of the group is on the left and is divisible by the prime.  Therefore the quantity on the right is.  But every orbit has index which divides the order of the group, so each term here is divisible by the prime.  Hence the order of the center must be divisible by the prime, and so is non-trivial.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: If \(|P|=p^2\) for a prime <i>p</i> then <i>P</i> is abelian.  In particular <i>P</i> is either \(Z_{p^2}\) or \(Z_p\times Z_p\).</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> By the previous theorem the center is not trivial.  Then <i>P/Z(P)</i> has order 1 or <i>p</i> but in either case it's cyclic.  Therefore <i>P</i> is abelian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for the more particular part.  If it has an element of order \(p^2\) we're done.  Otherwise every element has order <i>p</i> or 1.  Take one non-identity element, and another not in the set that the first one generates.  These two generate a group larger than the one that they generate individually, so they together generate the whole group.  It is now possible to set up an explicit isomorphism from \(\langle x\rangle \times \langle y\rangle \) to \(Z_p\times Z_p\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Conjugacy in \(S_n\)</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Conjugation for matrices is basically the "change of basis" from matrix to another.  For permutations the situation is analogous.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Theorem: For permutations \(\sigma,\tau\) the permutation \(\sigma\) has the same cycle type as \(\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}\).  Moreover, the entries in the conjugate are precisely what \(\tau\) sends each entry in \(\sigma\) to.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> If \(\sigma=(a_1 \ a_2 \ \dots \ a_p)(b_1 \ \dots \ b_q)\dots \) then the theorem claims that \(\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}\) is

        $$(\tau(a_1) \ \tau(a_2) \ \dots \ \tau(a_p)) (\tau(b_1) \ \dots \ \tau(b_q)) \dots $$
      </p>
      <p>
        The proof goes entirely by saying "Well if the theorem is true, and if \(\sigma\) sends some <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>, then let's see what \(\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}\) does to input \(\tau(i)\)."
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: Two permutations have the same cycle type if and only if they're conjugates.  There are as many conjugacy classes of \(S_n\) as there are partitions of the number <i>n</i>.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        We've already seen that conjugates have the same cycle type.  Now suppose \(\sigma, \tau\) have the same cycle type.  Then they have the same number of cycles each with the same length.  Pairing these up, we can construct a permutation by the pairing of the elements in these matching cycles.  Conjugating \(\sigma\) by this permutation produces \(\tau\) which can be seen easily by the previous theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        From having proved this first part we now know that the conjugacy classes of \(S_n\) just is the partition of the group by cycle types. Every cycle type corresponds to a partition of <i>n</i>, so we have the theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... Wait what?  How is there a cycle type per permutation of <i>n</i>?  This requires some more explanation.  Make the alignment like this:  For any given cycle type, the length of each factor cycle corresponds to a term in the partition.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: The elements that commute with any <i>m</i>-cycle are precisely those that are disjoint, those that are powers, or products of the two.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> We could have started this proof a long time ago, but we would have stalled out at a certain point.  But with the help of the theorem above, we can complete the proof.  We start by observing that of course any <i>m</i>-cycle commutes with all of its powers, and there are <i>m</i> of these.  Moreover, of course, it commutes with anything that is disjoint from it, and there are <i>(n-m)!</i> of these.  And of course, it commutes with any product of the two, and there are <i>m(n-m)!</i> of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question where we would have stalled out is: Are there any other elements which commute with the given <i>m</i>-cycle?  We can answer this question using what we now know about its centralizer and the relationship to its conjugacy class.  We know that its conjugacy class is the set of all permutations of the same cycle type.  And we know that, if we call the permutation \(\sigma\), the conjugacy class has size equal to \(|S_n:C_{S_n}(\sigma) = \frac{n!}{|C_{S_n}(\sigma)}\).
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an <i>m</i>-cycle it has a particularly easy to cycle type. There are \(\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-m+1)}{m}\) many <i>m</i>-cycles (the total number of ways to pick coordinates without replacement, divided by the number of "rotations" of these).  Putting all of the information we've gathered above together,

        $$ |C_{S_n}(\sigma)|=m(n-m)! $$
      </p>
      <p>
        What this tells us is that there are no other conjugates of \(\sigma\) than the ones we counted at the start!  Note that another way of understanding what this is saying, is that

        $$ C_{S_n}(\sigma) = \{\sigma^i\tau| 0\leq i < m, \text{ and } \tau \in S_{n-m}\} $$
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: \(A_5\) is simple.</h4>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> To show that \(A_5\) has no proper non-trivial normal subgroup, we will make use of the following general observation: For a normal subgroup, an element inside of it is never sent outside by conjugation; and an element outside is never sent inside.  Put more formally, if <i>H</i> is normal then \(x\in H\) if and only if \(gxg^{-1}\in H\) for every \(g\in G\). Part of this we already know immediately because we know that normal subgroups are closed under conjugation.  In the other direction, if we suppose that some conjugate of <i>x</i> is outside <i>H</i> then <i>x</i> must be outside of <i>H</i>.  For <i>x</i> were inside <i>H</i> this would entail that it's "inverse conjugate" sent it outside, which we know is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that another way of understanding what we've just learned is that every normal subgroup is the union of the conjugacy classes inside of it.  Because each conjugacy class is either entirely inside or entirely outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this is a property of all normal subgroups, we'll show that there cannot be any subgroup with this property.  And to do that, we'll work out the sizes of all the conjugacy classes in \(A_5\).  As a note about how we do this, keep in mind that two elments in \(A_5\) may be of the same cycle type but may not be conjugate to each other in \(A_5\), because \(A_5\) is not all of \(S_5\).  The element that conjugates one permutation to another of the same cycle type may be missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now notice that every cycle type in <i>A<sub>5</sub></i> is represented by the elements (1), (1 2 3), (1 2 3 4 5), and (1 2)(3 4).  And although being of the same cycle type doesn't entail being conjugate, being conjugate certainly still entails being of the same cycle type.  So every conjugacy class is made up of the same cycle type--there just might be multiple conjugacy classes of the same cycle type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start by analyzing the 3-cycles.  We know the only things in the centralizer of (1 2 3) are powers of this, times the elements which are disjoint.  But the only disjoint element in <i>A<sub>5</sub></i> is (1) so the centralizer is just <(1 2 3)> and this has size 3, hence its conjugacy class has size 60/3 = 20.  With the same sort of combinatorial analysis as we've been using, you can see that this is exactly the same as the total number of 3-cycles, so we've found that all 3-cycles are conjugate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's analyze the 5-cycles.  Again the only thing disjoint is (1) so the centralizer is <(1 2 3 4 5)> which has order 5 and therefore conjugacy class of size 60/5 = 12.  However, there are 24 different 5-cycles.  So what's in the conjugacy class of (1 2 3 4 5) and what's not?  An example of something that's not is (1 2)(1 2 3 4 5)(1 2) = (2 1 3 4 5).  Clearly that's because (1 2) is not in <i>A<sub>5</sub></i>.  In general a 5-cycle is not in the conjugacy class of (1 2 3 4 5) if it is conjugate by an odd permutation.  Since half of the 5-cycles are conjugate by even permutations and half by odd, then this is how the conjugacy classes split up.  There are two conjugacy classes of 5-cycles and there are 12 elements in each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally there are 60-20-24-1 = 15 different permutations in <i>A<sub>5</sub></i> which have type (1 2)(3 4).  For this, a brute-force check shows that (1 2)(3 4) commutes with every element of the same cycle type and nothing else, so that <i>|C<sub>A<sub>4</sub></sub>((1 2)(3 4))| = 4</i> and therefore the conjugacy class contains 60/4 = 15 which means it contains all 15 elements of the shared cycle type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, phew!  Nowe we know all the conjugacy classes and they have sizes 1, 12, 12, 15, and 20.  If any group were normal, from what we discussed at the start, it would have to have size a sum of these numbers.  But since non sum of these numbers divides 60, this is impossible.

          <i>Explanation:</i> It is very straight-forward to verify the first claim.  We can see that through conjugation by <i>g</i> we get a group action on <i>H</i>, and this action affords a permutation representation \(\pi(g)=\varphi_g\in S_H\).  The kernel of \(\pi\) being the set of group elements which map to the identity map, that means these group elements fix every \(h\in H\) under conjugation, which is equivalent to commuting.

          Note that the above proposition shows us that normal subgroups are structurally the same as their conjugates.

          <i>Explanation:</i> For any group <i>G</i> we know that \(G\trianglelefteq G\).  So conjugation by any <i>g</i> is an isomorphism and therefore its restriction to any subgroup <i>K</i> is also an isomorphism for <i>K</i>.

          Conjugation by <i>g</i> is called an <b>inner automorphism</b> of <i>G</i>.  The set of all inner automorphism is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms, and is denoted <i>Inn(G)</i>.  A subgroup is <b>characteristic</b>, denoted <i>H char G</i>, if it is fixed by every automorphism of <i>G</i>.  Characteristic groups are always normal.  If a subgroup is the unique group of a given order then it is characteristic.  And <i>K char H</i> together with \(H\trianglelefteq G\) entaisl \(K\trianglelefteq G\).  In this way they can be thought of as "strongly normal".

          <i>Explanation:</i> We build an isomorphism \(\Psi: Aut(Z_n)\to (Z_n)^\times\) by taking any automorphism \(\psi\) and chase the generator.  That is to say, \(\psi(1)=a\), and for no other automorphism can this be true.  Moreover since \(\psi\) is an automorphism then 1 and <i>a</i> have the same order, so <i>(a,n) = 1</i>.  In fact, this is an if and only if:  For every <i>a</i> coprime to <i>n</i> there is an automorphsim mapping 1 to <i>a</i>.  So

          $$\Psi(\psi) = \psi(1) \mod n $$

        Let <i>p</i> be a prime, and \(p^\alpha\not\mid m\).  We define:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <b><i>p</i>-group</b> is any group of order <i>p<sup>&alpha;</sup></i>.  Similarly we call <b><i>p</i>-subgroups</b> any subgroup of order <i>p<sup>&alpha;</sup></i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <b>Sylow <i>p</i>-subgroup</b> is a subgroup of order <i>p<sup>&alpha;</sup></i> which is inside of a group of order <i>p<sup>&alpha;</sup>m</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The set of Sylow <i>p</i>-subgroups is denoted <i>Syl<sub>p</sub>(G)</i> and the number of Sylow <i>p</i>-subgroups <i>n<sub>p</sub>(G)</i>.

        <i>Explanation:</i> For the first claim, we proceed by induction on the order of <i>G</i>.  When <i>|G| = 1</i> there is nothing to prove.  Now with <i>|G| = p<sup>&alpha;</sup>m > 1</i>, we divide into two cases: Either <i>p | Z(G)</i> or not.  If it does then by Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups, <i>Z(G)</i> has a subgroup <i>N</i> of order <i>p</i>.  Apply the inductive hypothesis to <i>G/N</i>. We can use this with the isomorphism theorems to wrangle the subgroup we want.
