    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h1>Introduction to Groups</h1>
    <h2>1.1 Basic Axioms and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Groups</b> are defined by an <b>associative binary operation</b> on some set, which has an <b>identity</b> and <b>inverse</b>.  A group is <b>abelian</b> if the operation <b>commutes</b>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Examples are vector spaces under addition, \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\), and we introduce the multiplicative group of integers mod <i>n</i>, \((\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times\).  This later by definition only includes the integers wich have a multiplicative inverse mod <i>n</i>.  We also introduce the <b>direct product group</b> \(A\times B\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
          We derive some basic facts about groups.  The identity is unique, which you can see by multiplying two identities together.  Inverses are unique which you see by multiplying one element by two inverses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inverse of the inverse is the original.  Because if you mutliply it times the inverse you get the identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inverse reverse distributes just by multiplying this in a direct check.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Also we introduce the notation \(x^{-n}\) for the <i>n</i>th application of the inverse.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We define the <b>order</b> of <i>x</i> as the least power which yields the identity, \(|x|\).
      </p>
      <p>
        We define the <b>group table</b> as that which sumarizes all group products of two elemenst.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.2 Dihedral Groups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        \(D_{2n}\) is the group of symmetric rigid motions of a polygon of <i>n</i> vertices.  There are <i>n</i> rotations including the trivial one, generated by the smallest counter-clockwise rotational symmetry <i>r</i>.  <i>s</i> is the reflection through the vertex labeled 1 and the origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        We show some basic facts, like that the powers of <i>r</i> are distinct up to <i>n</i>, and <i>|s|=2</i>, and the reflection is not any rotation.  The first interesting fact is that \(rs = sr^{-1}\) and in general \(r^i s = sr^{-i}\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Generators and Relations</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        A set <b>generates</b> a group if every group element is some combination in the set.  A <b>presentation</b> is a set of elements and relations among them, such that all other relations may be derived.  The dihedral group is generated by <i>r, s</i> and is presented by the relations \(r^n=s^2=1, rs=sr^{-1}\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.3 Symmetric Groups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        We denote by \(S_n\) the group of symmetries on 1, 2, ..., <i>n</i>.  A <b>cycle</b> is the permutation \(a_1, ..., a_m\).  Any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles by chasing their mappings.  Disjoint cycles don't "interact" so they commute.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.4 Matrix Groups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Introduce the <b>general linear group</b> and the <b>special linear group</b>, \(GL_n, SL_n\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>1.5 The Quaternion Group</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        \(Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}\) with \(ij=k\) and \(ji=-k\) and so on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.6 Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>homomorphism</b> is a map which respects the group operation--you get the same thing if you map and then operate, or operate then map.  An <b>isomorphism</b> is a homomorphism that's bijective.  Isomorphic groups, written \(A\cong B\) are basically the same up to relabeling.  
      </p>
    </div>
