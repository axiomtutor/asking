    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h1>Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms</h1>
    <h2>3.1 Definitions and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Let \(\varphi:G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphsim.  We've already seen that if it's an isomorphism then <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are the same.  By the same token if it's not surjective but injective, then a copy of <i>G</i> lives in <i>H</i>.  However, even when \(\varphi\) is not injective there is still some amount of shared structure between <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>.  The quotient group describes this shared structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular when \(\varphi\) is not injective many elements of <i>G</i> map to a single element in <i>H</i>.  We call the "many elements" a <b>fiber</b>.  More formally, if \(h\in H\) then the "fiber over <i>h</i>" is

        $$ \{g\in G: \varphi(g) = h\} $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Since every fiber corresponds to an element in <i>H</i>, the set of fibers acts exactly like the group <i>H</i>.  So in this way we have split <i>G</i> up into a partition, and the cells of the partition form a group.  Note that the identity of a group is an important element, so we similarly stress the importance of the fiber above \(\mathbb 1\).  We call this the <b>kernel</b> of \(\varphi\) and write it as \(ker\varphi\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The map may be both not injective and not surjective.  Therefore not every element of <i>H</i> has a fiber above it.  So we use \(im\varphi\) to denote the <b>image</b> of the map.  Every element in the image does have a fiber above it.
      </p>

        In preparation for further ideas, we first derive a few facts about homomorphisms beyond those already derived in chapter 2.  Homomorphisms always:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps the identity to the identity.</i> Because \(\varphi(\mathbb 1) = \varphi(\mathbb 1 \cdot\mathbb 1)\) and so on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps inverses to inverses.</i> \(\varphi(gg^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(\mathbb 1) \) and so on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps powers to powers.</i>  Same logic as before.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>\(ker\varphi \leq G\).</i>  A direct check confirms this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>\(im\varphi \leq H\).</i>  Direct check.
            </p>
          </li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We're now ready to define the group of fibers discussed earlier.  It is called the <b>factor group</b>, written as \(G/ker\varphi\).  The operation between the fiber above <i>a</i> and the fiber above <i>b</i> is defined as the fiber above <i>ab</i>.  So in effect the group <i>H</i> defines this operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The division symbol is evocative of the fact that we are partitioning, or dividing up, the group <i>G</i>.  The analogy will only grow stronger as we learn more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Since the definition of the operation in the factor group is given by the operation in <i>H</i>, one might wonder if we could instead simply perform the operation if we ignore <i>H</i> and only use the fibers.  Of course one group operation is already clear: whichever fiber has \(\mathbb 1\) is the identity element of the factor group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we infer for any two fibers, which fiber their product is?  Continue with insights that are clearest about the kernel.  For instance, multiplying an element of a fiber by an element of the kernel doesn't change its fiber.  This is a compelling idea since the kernel acts like \(\mathbb 1\).  Put more formally, for any fiber <i>X</i> and element <i>u</i>, and element of the kernel, <i>k</i>, then \(uk \in X\).  This is because \(\varphi(uk) = \varphi(u)\).
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, every fiber is of the form \(uK\) where <i>K</i> is the kernel, and <i>u</i> is any arbitrarily chosen element of the fiber.  Call the fiber <i>X</i> again, and the argument from earlier already establishes \(uK\subseteq X\).  For the reverse, take any \(g\in X\) and construct a \(k\in K\) such that <i>g = uk</i>.  The construction of <i>k</i> is obviously \(k = u^{-1}g\).  It's easy to show this is in fact an element of the kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important note is that we could reproduce the previous claims for <i>Ku</i>.  Since both are equal to the fiber containing <i>u</i> then they're equal to each other.  That is to say <i>uK = Ku</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we will very often use <i>uK</i> rather than fibers and homomorphisms, we give this a name.  It is called a <b>left coset</b> and of course right cosets are similarly defined.  <i>u</i> is called a <b>representative</b>.  Any element from a coset can be used as a representative.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: Coset operations on kernels are as you'd hope: <i>(uK)(vK) = (uv)K</i>.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
         We are assuming <i>K</i> is the kernel of a homomorphism.  Identify these cosets with fibers and unravel the definitions.  A fairly direct use of the homomorphism distribution concludes the proof.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Now we may want to even further remove the notion of a homomorphism.  Can we take any subset of <i>G</i> and form a group of cosets?  If you want this to still form a partition, then no.  In \(\mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z\) we can see that {0,3} doesn't work: 1+{0,3} = {1,0}.  If you don't have a partition then you can't talk in terms of representatives, since two cells now share elements.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: Cosets formed from subgroups form a partition, and equal cosets contain both representatives.</h4>

      <p>
        If <i>H</i> is any subgroup of <i>G</i> then to show the set of cosets forms a partition, we first show that every element of <i>G</i> is in some coset.  Since \(\mathbb 1 \in H\) then \(g\in gH\).
      </p>
      <p>
        To show disjointedness we argue that if two cosets <i>uH</i> and <i>vH</i> share any element then they share every element.  If <i>x = un = vm</i> is in both, then for any \(un' \in uN\) we argue \(un'\in vN\).  Of course we leverage <i>x</i> to exchange a <i>u</i> for a <i>v</i>, invoke the closedness of <i>H</i>, and so on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: <i>uH = vH</i> if and only if \(H = u^{-1}vH\) if and only if \(u^{-1}v\in H\).</h4>
