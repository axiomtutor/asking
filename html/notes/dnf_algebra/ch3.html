    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h1>Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms</h1>
    <h2>3.1 Definitions and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Let \(\varphi:G \rightarrow H\) be a homomorphsim.  We've already seen that if it's an isomorphism then <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are the same.  By the same token if it's not surjective but injective, then a copy of <i>G</i> lives in <i>H</i>.  However, even when \(\varphi\) is not injective there is still some amount of shared structure between <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>.  The quotient group describes this shared structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular when \(\varphi\) is not injective many elements of <i>G</i> map to a single element in <i>H</i>.  We call the "many elements" a <b>fiber</b>.  More formally, if \(h\in H\) then the "fiber over <i>h</i>" is

        $$ \{g\in G: \varphi(g) = h\} $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Since every fiber corresponds to an element in <i>H</i>, the set of fibers acts exactly like the group <i>H</i>.  So in this way we have split <i>G</i> up into a partition, and the cells of the partition form a group.  Note that the identity of a group is an important element, so we similarly stress the importance of the fiber above \(\mathbb 1\).  We call this the <b>kernel</b> of \(\varphi\) and write it as \(ker\varphi\).
      </p>
      <p>
        The map may be both not injective and not surjective.  Therefore not every element of <i>H</i> has a fiber above it.  So we use \(im\varphi\) to denote the <b>image</b> of the map.  Every element in the image does have a fiber above it.
      </p>

        In preparation for further ideas, we first derive a few facts about homomorphisms beyond those already derived in chapter 2.  Homomorphisms always:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps the identity to the identity.</i> Because \(\varphi(\mathbb 1) = \varphi(\mathbb 1 \cdot\mathbb 1)\) and so on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps inverses to inverses.</i> \(\varphi(gg^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(\mathbb 1) \) and so on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>Maps powers to powers.</i>  Same logic as before.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>\(ker\varphi \leq G\).</i>  A direct check confirms this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>\(im\varphi \leq H\).</i>  Direct check.
            </p>
          </li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We're now ready to define the group of fibers discussed earlier.  It is called the <b>factor group</b>, written as \(G/ker\varphi\).  The operation between the fiber above <i>a</i> and the fiber above <i>b</i> is defined as the fiber above <i>ab</i>.  So in effect the group <i>H</i> defines this operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The division symbol is evocative of the fact that we are partitioning, or dividing up, the group <i>G</i>.  The analogy will only grow stronger as we learn more.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Since the definition of the operation in the factor group is given by the operation in <i>H</i>, one might wonder if we could instead simply perform the operation if we ignore <i>H</i> and only use the fibers.  Of course one group operation is already clear: whichever fiber has (mathbb 1) is the identity element of the factor group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we infer for any two fibers, which fiber their product is?  Continue with insights that are clearest about the kernel.  For instance, multiplying an element of a fiber by an element of the kernel doesn't change its fiber.  This is a compelling idea since the kernel acts like \(\mathbb 1\).  Put more formally, for any fiber <i>X</i> and element <i>u</i>, and element of the kernel, <i>k</i>, then \(uk \in X\).
