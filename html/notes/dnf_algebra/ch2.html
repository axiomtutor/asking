    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h1>Subgroups</h1>
    <h2>2.1 Definition and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>subgroup</b> is a subset that's a group. An equivalent condition is that it's a nonempty subset which has every \(xy^{-1}\).  If <i>H</i> is a subgroup of <i>G</i> we write \(H\leq G\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.2 Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>centralizer</b> \(C_G(A)\) is the set of all group elements that fix each of <i>A</i> under conjugation.  It is a subgroup of <i>G</i>.  The <b>center</b> \(Z(G)\) is the set of elements that commute with everything.  The <b>normalizer</b> \(N_G(A)\) is the set of elements that fix ALL of <i>A</i> under conjugation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these are pure group concepts and need not reference actions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Stabilizers and Kernels of Group Actions</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>stabilizer</b> of a G-set element <i>s</i> is \(G_s\), the set of all group elements which fix <i>s</i>.  The fact that centralizers, normalizers, and centers are subgroups are all special cases of the fact that stabilizers are subgroups.  For cecntralizers, use the group action of conjugation; for the center, notice that this is the kernel of the same action.  For normalizers use the action of conjugation on subsets of <i>G</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A group is <b>cyclic</b> if it's generated by a single element.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: If \(x^a = \mathbb 1\) then \(|x|\) divides <i>a</i>.</h4>
      <p>
        If \(x^m=\mathbb 1 = x^n\) then if \(d=(m,n)\) then we have

        $$ x^d=\mathbb 1 $$
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular if \(x^m=\mathbb 1\) then the order of <i>x</i> divides <i>m</i>.  The proof goes by Bezout's identity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: Cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.</h4>
      <p>Map generator to generator and let the homomorphism guide the rest.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: The order of a power of a generator is the order over the gcd.</h4>
      <p>
        $$ |x^a| = \frac{|x|}{(|x|,a)} $$

        To see this write <i>|x|</i> and <i>a</i> as mutliples of <i>d</i>.

        $$ |x| = db, \quad a = dc $$
      </p>
      <p>
        With this notation we want to show \(|x^a| = b\).  We can show \(|x^a|\) divides <i>b</i> just by taking a power of <i>b</i>.  To show that <i>b</i> divides \(|x^a|\) we think about the fact that \((x^a)^{|x^a|} = \mathbb 1\).  This entails that \(|x|\) divides \(a|x^a|\).  With a little more unraveling and a number-theoretic proof that \((b,c) = 1\) you find that \(|b|\) divides \(|x^a|\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: If \(G = \langle x\rangle\) then also \(G = \langle x^a\rangle\) if and only if <i>a</i> and <i>n</i> are coprime.  In particular the number of generators is \(\varphi(n)\) where <i>n</i> is the order and \(\varphi\) is Euler's totient function.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        The argument goes entirely by the order of the subgroup generated by \(x^a\).  It's everything if and only if it's order is the order of the group.  By the previous theorem, that happens precisely when the order and power are coprime.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: Subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        Take the smallest positive <i>d</i> such that \(x^d\) is in the group.  Argue that this generates the group by exhibiting any other element as some \(x^a\) and then decomposing into quotients and remainders.  Minimality implies the remainder must be 0.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: For cyclic groups, there is a unique subgroup for every divisor of the order.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        Show that the order of \(x^{n/a}\) witnesses the claim.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Theorem: If <i>n</i> is the order of a cyclic group then \(\langle x^m\rangle = \langle x^{(n,m)}\rangle\).</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        Certainly \(\langle x^m\rangle \leq \langle x^{(n,m)}\rangle \).  From the formula for orders of powers of generators, they have the same size.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.4 Subgroups Generated by Subsets</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The smallest subgroup which contains a set \(A\subseteq G\)</b> is the intersection over all subgroups which contain <i>A</i>.  It is easy to show this is a subgroup.  It is also called <b>the subgroup generated by <i>A</i></b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the top-down approach; we can arrive at the same subgroup by closing the set under the operation and inverses.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.5 The Lattice of Subgroups of a Group</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>join</b> of subgroups <i>H, K</i> is the smallest subgroup which contains both.  It is written \(\langle H, K\rangle \).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>lattice of subgroups</b> is a visualization of all subgroups of a group.  It places larger groups higher, and draws edges between subgroups if one is a "direct" subgroup of the other (i.e. there is no other subgroup "in-between").
      </p>
      <img src="../../../images/dnf_algebra/latticeZ12.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We can use the lattice to help determine certain subgroups.  Since for instance, the centralizer, center, normalizer, and other defined structures are subgroups, they must occur in the lattice.  Since the lattice is often listed in terms of generators, we can check whether the generator is in the group to determine if the groups are equal.
