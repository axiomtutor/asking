    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h1>Subgroups</h1>
    <h2>2.1 Definition and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>subgroup</b> is a subset that's a group. An equivalent condition is that it's a nonempty subset that has every \(xy^{-1}\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.2 Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>centralizer</b> \(C_G(A)\) is the set of all group elements that fix each of <i>A</i> under conjugation.  It is a subgroup of <i>G</i>.  The <b>center</b> \(Z(G)\) is the set of elements that commute with everything.  The <b>normalizer</b> \(N_G(A)\) is the set of elements that fix ALL of <i>A</i> under conjugation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these are pure group concepts and need not reference actions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Stabilizers and Kernels of Group Actions</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>stabilizer</b> of a G-set element <i>s</i> is \(G_s\), the set of all group elements which fix <i>s</i>.  The fact that centralizers, normalizers, and centers are subgroups are all special cases of the fact that stabilizers are subgroups.  For cecntralizers, use the group action of conjugation; for the center, notice that this is the kernel of the same action.  For normalizers use the action of conjugation on subsets of <i>G</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A group is <b>cyclic</b> if it's generated by a single element.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the generator a cyclic group raised to some two powers, each yields \(\mathbb{1}\), then their gcd does.  In particular, the order of an element always divides a power which yields \(\mathbb{1}\).  
      </p>
    </div>
