    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h1>Subgroups</h1>
    <h2>2.1 Definition and Examples</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>subgroup</b> is a subset that's a group. An equivalent condition is that it's a nonempty subset which has every \(xy^{-1}\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.2 Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>centralizer</b> \(C_G(A)\) is the set of all group elements that fix each of <i>A</i> under conjugation.  It is a subgroup of <i>G</i>.  The <b>center</b> \(Z(G)\) is the set of elements that commute with everything.  The <b>normalizer</b> \(N_G(A)\) is the set of elements that fix ALL of <i>A</i> under conjugation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these are pure group concepts and need not reference actions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Stabilizers and Kernels of Group Actions</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The <b>stabilizer</b> of a G-set element <i>s</i> is \(G_s\), the set of all group elements which fix <i>s</i>.  The fact that centralizers, normalizers, and centers are subgroups are all special cases of the fact that stabilizers are subgroups.  For cecntralizers, use the group action of conjugation; for the center, notice that this is the kernel of the same action.  For normalizers use the action of conjugation on subsets of <i>G</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A group is <b>cyclic</b> if it's generated by a single element.
      </p>
      <h4>Theorem: If \(x^a = \mathbb 1\) then \(|x|\) divides <i>a</i>.</h4>
      <p>
        If \(x^m=\mathbb 1 = x^n\) then if \(d=(m,n)\) then we have

        $$ x^d=\mathbb 1 $$
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular if \(x^m=\mathbb 1\) then the order of <i>x</i> divides <i>m</i>.  The proof goes by Bezout's identity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: Cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.</h4>
      <p>Map generator to generator and let the homomorphism guide the rest.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Theorem: The order of a power of a generator is the order over the gcd.</h4>
      <p>
        $$ |x^a| = |x|/(|x|,a) $$

        To see this write <i>|x|</i> and <i>a</i> as mutliples of <i>d</i>.

        $$ |x| = db, \quad a = dc $$
      </p>
      <p>
        With this notation we want to show \(|x^a| = b\).  We can show \(|x^a|\) divides <i>b</i> just by taking a power of <i>b</i>.  To show that <i>b</i> divides \(|x^a|\) we think about the fact that \((x^a)^{|x^a|} = \mathbb 1\).  This entails that \(|x|\) divides \(a|x^a|\).  With a little more unraveling and a number-theoretic proof that \((b,c) = 1\) you find that \(|b|\) divides \(|x^a|\).
      </p>
