    <p>Throughout this chapter we will assume that the field of scalars is the real or complex numbers.</p>
    <h1>6.1 Inner product spaces</h1>
    <p class="def">The <b>dot-product</b> is the sum over coordinate-wise products. An inner-product is a generalization of this, with the properties: <i>positivity, definiteness, left additivity, left homogeneity, and conjugate symmetry</i>.  Examples include the Euclidean inner product, an arbitrary coordinate-wise positive weighting of the dot-product, the definite integral on an interval over the product, and something like the Laplace transform.</p>
    <p class="def">An <b>inner-product space</b> is a vector space with an inner-product.</p>
    <p class="theorem">
      <b>Theorem: </b> An inner-product satisfies the properties <br><br>
      (a) For a fixed <i>u</i> the function of <i>v</i> defined by \(\langle v,u\rangle \) is a linear functional.  <br><br>
      (b) \( \langle 0,u\rangle =0 \) <br>
      (c) \( \langle u,0 \rangle=0\) <br>
      (d) right-additivity <br>
      (e) "twisty" right-homogeneity 
    </p>
    <p class="def">
      The <b>norm</b> of any vector is \(\| \vec{v} \|^2 = \vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} \).  
    </p>
    <p class="theorem">
      <b>Theorem: </b> A norm always satisfies <br> 
      (a) \( \|\vec{v}\| = 0\)  <br>
      (b) \( \|\lambda\vec{v}\| = |\lambda|\|\vec{v}\| \)
    </p>
    <p class="def">Vectors are <b>orthogonal</b> if their product is 0.</p>
    <p class="theorem"><b>Theorem: </b> The Pythagorean Theorem for vectors.</p>
    <p class="proof">
      <b>Proof: </b> We want to show \( \|\vec{u}\|^2+\|\vec{v}\|^2 = \|\vec{u}+\vec{v}\|^2\) if \(\langle\vec{u},\vec{v}\rangle=0\).  This is the same as 
      
      $$\langle\vec{u},\vec{u}\rangle\ +\ \langle\vec{v},\vec{v}\rangle = \langle\vec{u}+\vec{v},\ \vec{u}+\vec{v}\rangle$$
      
      which clearly is equivalent to the claim that 
      
      $$0=\langle \vec{u},\vec{v}\rangle+\langle \vec{v},\vec{u}\rangle$$
      
      and by the assumption of orthogonality, each term on the right is 0.

    <p class="def">
      We now build up the Gram-Schmidt procedure starting with two vectors in <i>F<sup>n</sup></i> with <i>n</i>>1.  This is just the <b>orthogonal projection</b> of one vector onto another, which we can generalize to projection of a vector onto a space, which gives an algorithm for generating an ortho-normal basis.  The orthogonal projection of \(\vec{u}\) onto \(\vec{v}\) is the vector \(\vec{w}\) such that \(\vec{w}\) is: (a) parallel to \(\vec{v}\) (i.e. \(\vec{w}=c\vec{v}\) ) and (b) the vector \(\vec{u}-\vec{w}\) is orthogonal to \(\vec{v}\).  Solving for <i>c</i> in the equation
      
      $$\langle \vec{u}-c\vec{v}, \vec{v} \rangle = 0$$
      
      for known vectors \(\vec{u},\vec{v}\) is a simple matter and results in 
      
      $$c = \frac{\langle \vec{u},\vec{v}\rangle}{\|\vec{v}\|^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \vec{w} = \frac{\langle\vec{u},\vec{v}\rangle}{\|\vec{v}\|^2}\vec{v}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      If we next have three vectors, call them \(\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3\in F^n\), suppose we state a new goal but one that is related to the previous goal:  We would like to have three vectors orthogonal to each other and spans the same space that \(\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3\) spans.  We assume now that <i>n</i>>2 so that such a goal is possible.  
    </p>
    <p>We can proceed in steps:  If we take \(\vec{v}_1\) to start it is trivially orthogonal to all other vectors because there are no other vectors.  If we add \(\vec{v}_2\) then the set is no longer orthogonal but we may get the orthogonal projection \(\vec{w}\) as above and then add \(\vec{v}_2-\vec{w}\) to the set.  If we call this \(proj_{\vec{v}_1}(\vec{v}_2)\)
