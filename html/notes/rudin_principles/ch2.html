    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h1>Basic Topology</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h2>Finite, Countable, and Uncountable Sets</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        I don't know why this section is in a chapter on topology, it could have gone in a section on mere pre-requisites.  We define familiar ideas about <b>functions, domain, range, image, into, onto, inverse, one-to-one, corerspondence, cardinality, equivalence relation, finite, infinite, countable, and uncountable.</b>  One oddity is that finite sets are not defined in such a way as to be countable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later we define <b>sequence, union, intersection, and disjiont</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way we prove the following.
      </p>
      <h3>Theorem: Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable.</h3>
      <h3>Theorem: The usual set laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity are true.</h3>
      <h3>Theorem: Countable unions of countable sets are countable.</h3>
      <h3>Theorem: The cartesian product of countable sets is countable.</h3>
      <h3>
        Theorem: The rationals are countable.
      </h3>
      <h3>Theorem: The set of all sequences of 0s and 1s is uncountable.</h3>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h2>Metric Spaces</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Again I'm not sure why this is in topology per se, since topologies don't always have distance metrics.  But here we define a <b>distance metric</b> by positivity, zero if and only if the points are equal, commutativity, and the triangle inequality.  On the real line we define the <b>segment</b> (<i>a, b</i>) to be the set of all numbers <i>a < x < b</i>.  By the <b>interval</b> [<i>a,b</i>] we mean all \(a \leq x\leq b\).  A <b>k-cell</b> is all \(\vec x \in \mathbb R^k\) such that for each coordinate there is an interval the coordinate must be in.  The <b>open ball</b> centered at \(\vec x\in \mathbb R^k\) with radius <i>r</i> is the set of all \(\vec y\in \mathbb R^k\) such that \(|\vec x - \vec y | < r\).  A set <i>E</i> is <b>convex</b> if for every \(\vec x,\vec y\in \mathbb R^k\) and every \(0 < \lambda < 1\) we have

        $$ \lambda \vec x + (1-\lambda)\vec y \in E $$
      </p>
      <p>
        A <b>neighborhood</b> around the point \(p\in X\) of radius <i>r</i> is denoted by \(N_r(p)\) and is the set of all points within distance <i>r</i> of <i>p</i>.  A <b>limit point</b> of a set <i>E</i> is any point such that a neighborhood always contains some other part of <i>E</i>.  An <b>isolated point</b> of <i>E</i> is a point in <i>E</i> that is not a limit point.  <i>E</i> is <b>closed</b> if it contains all its limit points.  A point is an <b>interior point</b> if there is some neighborhood around it which is entirely in <i>E</i>.  <i>E</i> is <b>open</b> if every point is interior.  <i>E</i> is <b>perfect</b> if a point is in it if and only if it's a limit point.  <i>E</i> is <b>dense in <i>X</i></b> if every point in <i>X</i> is either in <i>E</i> or a limit point of <i>E</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: Neighborhoods are open sets.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Take any neighborhood and show every point in it is an interior point.  To do that, fit a neighborhood around the new point which fits inside the first neighborhood.  To do that you need to pick the right radius.  If you draw a picture you can convince yourself that the right radius is the first radius minus the distance between the points.
        </p>
        <p>
          (You can draw the picture pretty easily in two dimensions, although it works in one or three.  This problem doesn't assume we're in a Euclidean space so the picture is merely meant to motivate a choice of radius, but is not a proof.  The proof uses the triangle inequality, after you've made this well-motivated guess about the choice of radius.)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: If <i>p</i> is a limit point of <i>E</i> then <i>E</i> contains infinitely many points.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> The picture makes this obvious, and it's not too much work to turn the picture into a proof.  Draw any blob of a set <i>E</i> and pick a limit point.  Best to draw it on the edge of the set <i>E</i> since that's where the most interesting limit points live.  Put any neighborhood around <i>p</i>.  By definition as a limit point, we get some distinct other point in <i>E</i>, call it \(q_1\).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we generate a \(q_2\).  How?  We need it to be distinct from \(q_1\), and we can guarantee this if we use \(d(p,q_1)\) as the radius of a new neighborhood around <i>p</i>. Get a point from inside there, call it \(q_2\).  The radius puts \(q_1\) outside this new neighborhood so the \(q_2\ne q_1\) and we have a genuinely new point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generate \(q_3\) with a neighborhood of radius \(d(p,q_2)\), and generate \(q_4\) with a neighborhood of radius \(d(p,q_3)\) and so on.
          </p>

        <h3>
          Corollary: A finite set has no limit points.
        </h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> Notice that you can prove this directly without too much difficulty.  Still, it's a nice corollary from the previous theorem.  In fact, it is just the contrapositive of the previous theorem.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: De Morgan's law is true.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            Why is this here?  This is a set theory fact and should be in some section with set theory facts.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation: </i> We prove each direction separately.  First suppose <i>E</i> is open, we want to prove \(E^c\) contains all its limit points, so say that <i>x</i> is one.  This easily entails by definition that <i>x</i> is not interior to <i>E</i>, but <i>E</i> is made up only of interior points.  So \(x\not\in E\) so \(x\in E^c\).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next suppose \(E^c\) is closed, and show that any point in <i>E</i> is interior.  By being in <i>E</i> then <i>x</i> cannot be a limit point of \(E^c\), and that gives you what you need to put a neighborhood around <i>x</i> which is entirely in <i>E</i>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: A set is clsoed if and only if its complement is open.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> This is a very nice and easy corollary to the previous theorem.  If <i>F</i> is closed, then the complement of \(F^c\) is closed and therefore \(F^c\) is open.  Do similarly to go in the other direction.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: Unions of open sets are open.  Finite intersections of open sets are open.  Intersections of closed sets are closed.  Finite unions of closed sets are closed.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation: </i>The easiest claim in here is the first one.  If you pick a point in the union it must have come from one of the open sets, and now put a neighborhood fitting inside that set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having proved the first claim, the next easiest is that intersections of closed sets are closed.  Construct the closed set as the complement of an open set, which by De Morgans is now a union of open sets, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            For finite intersections of open sets, finiteness is the key: Any point in the intersection is in all the open sets.  For each of them, take a neighborhood. Then take the least radius of those neighborhoods (which exists because there are only finitely many of them).  That will fit in all of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unsurprisingly, we can again leverage complements and De Morgan's to prove the claim about closed sets from the fact about open sets.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The <b>closure</b> of a set <i>E</i> is the set unioned with its limit points.  We denote the set of limit points by <i>E'</i> and the closure by \(\overline E\).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: The closure of any set is closed.  A set is closed if and only if it equals its closure.  \(\overline E\) is contained in any closed set that contains <i>E</i>.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> We start with showing that the closure of any set is closed. Rudin proves that the complement is open, which is nice.  But I go for a direct proof: Take any limit point of \(\overline E\).  Intuitively it's either a limit point of <i>E</i> or a limit point of <i>E'</i>.  If it's a limit point of <i>E</i> we're done because it's automatically in <i>E'</i>.  But if it's a limit point of <i>E'</i> then we still need to do some work to show that this is a limit point of <i>E</i>.  Intuitively that should be true because if anything is infinitely to <i>E'</i> and <i>E'</i> is infinitely close to <i>E</i>, then the point should also be infinitely close to <i>E</i>.  But all of this is just getting some intuitions--next we need a plan for a rigorous proof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <i>x</i> be a limit point of \(\overline E\).  We are trying to show it's a limit point of <i>E</i>, so let's put a neighborhood \(N_r(x)\) around it.  We want to show that \(N_r(x)\) must have a point other than <i>x</i> which is in <i>E</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there is a point \(y\in E\cup E'\) in the neighborhood where \(x\ne y\) then if \(y\in E\) we're done.  If \(y\in E'\) then ... well, we can put a neighborhood around <i>y</i> which must intersect <i>E</i>.  If we can choose this neighborhood small enough so that the whole thing fits inside the original neighborhood, then we're done.  But to do this is just like how we showed that all neighborhoods are open.  We draw a picture and let it motivate a choice of radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>For the claim that a set is closed just in case it equals its closure:</i>  One direction is trivial.  If \(E=\overline E\) then since we already proved \(\overline E\) is closed, automatically <i>E</i> is closed.  The other direction is actually also trivial because if <i>E</i> is closed then it contains all its limit points, so \(E'\subseteq E\) and therefore \(E = E\cup E' = \overline E\).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              That \(\overline E\) is contained in any closed set that contains <i>E</i>:
            </i> Let <i>F</i> be any closed set with \(E\subseteq F\).  We will have \(\overline E \subseteq F\) if we can just show \(E'\subseteq F\).  So if <i>x</i> is any limit point we need to show it's in <i>F</i>.  Clearly we need to appeal to the closedness of <i>F</i>, but you quickly realize that <i>F</i> containing its limit points means it also contains the limit points of <i>E</i>.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: The sup of a nonempty bounded set is always in the closure.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> This naturally breaks into two cases, depending on whether the sup is in the set or not.  If it is, the case is trivial.  If it's not then we prove it's a limit point.  We take a neighborhood of the sup and in particular look at the part that's below the sup.  Since this region is less than the sup, none of it is an upper-bound and so there must exist some element of the set above.  Because the sup was not in the set, this element that we've found cannot be the sup itself.  Hence we found a distinct point in the neighborhood.

      <div>
        <p>
          It sometimes happens that we study a space, <i>X</i>, but then want to study some subspace \(Y\subset X\).  Sets that were open in <i>X</i> may no longer be open if we regard it as now living just in <i>Y</i>.  For instance, [0,1) is actually an open set if the universal set is \([0,\infty)\).  Hence it really is illegitimate to say that a set is open--we can only say that it is open "relative to" the metric space we consider it to live in.  We rarely need to worry about this subtlety but when we do, we have the following helpful theorem.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Theorem: Suppose \(Y\subseteq X\).  A set <i>E</i> is open relative to <i>Y</i> if and only if \(E=Y\cap G\) for some set <i>G</i> which is open relative to <i>X</i>.
        </h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>
              Explanation:
            </i> Use the example of \(E = [0,1)\) being open relative to \(Y = [0,\infty)\) for motivation.  We can see that \(E = Y\cap G\) with \(G = (-1,1)\).  The over-hang on the left side gets chopped off by <i>Y</i> so it doesn't matter. We could have used (-2,1) and it would have worked just as well for a choice of <i>G</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way to see this is to imagine the point 0.1 in [0,1) and the neighborhood of radius 0.2.  If we are living in <i>Y</i> when we do this, the neighborhood is [0,0.3).  But if we did this when living in <i>X</i> the neighborhood would have been (-0.1, 0.3).  But the neighborhood from <i>X</i> is still a good neighborhood in <i>Y</i> if we just intersect it with <i>Y</i> first.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gives an indication of how to prove the left-to-right direction.  We build the set <i>G</i> by taking points in <i>E</i> and neighborhoods which fit within it while living in <i>Y</i>.  We use the same radius, but now construct the neighborhood while living in <i>X</i>.  Unioning all these neighborhoods constructs <i>G</i>.  Intersecting with <i>Y</i> lops off the part that gets us back down to <i>E</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>For the right-to-left:</i> This just falls right out of definitions.

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h2>Compact Sets</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        An <b>open cover</b> of a set is any collection of open sets which covers.  "Covers" means that the set is contained in the union of the collection.  A set is <b>compact</b> if every open cover has a finite subcover.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: Compactness survives the restriction to a subspace.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> More formally, the theorem claims that if \(K\subseteq Y\subset X\) then <i>K</i> is compact relative to <i>X</i> if and only if it's compact relative to <i>Y</i>. To to left-to-right: take an open cover relative to <i>Y</i> and then use the fact that open sets relative to <i>Y</i> have an open set <i>G</i> relative to <i>X</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
           The right-to-left is similar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: Compactness entails closedness.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>
            Explanation:
          </i> In general when proving openness or closedness we have an option.  To prove that a compact set is closed, we can either directly prove it contains its limit points or we can prove its complement is open.  In this case it's hard for me to imagine linking the idea of a limit point to an open cover.  But to show the complement is open, we can can use a point outside the set to build an open cover.  So let's chase down that line of thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            We pick a point in the complement, \(p\in K^c\) and try to build an open set <i>V</i> around it that is guaranteed to be entirely in the complement, i.e. \(V\subseteq K^c\).  To do this, we take every point <i>in</i> the compact set, \(q\in K\), and build two open sets, one around <i>p</i> and one around <i>q</i>.  These two open sets, call them \(V_q\) and \(W_q\), split the difference the distance from <i>p</i> to <i>q</i>.  Intuitively, the <i>V</i>s will cover <i>p</i> and eventually become our <i>V</i> by taking intersections.  And <i>W</i>s will become the open cover from which we select a finite subcover.  With these insights in mind, the rest is chasing down the details.

      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> Clearly somehow the closed set inside has to leverage the compact superset.  We take an open cover of the closed set and don't yet know why there should be a finite subcover, since this isn't necessarily an open cover of the superset.  But here's the kicker: We can add one more open set to get an open cover of the superset.  It's the complement of the closed set.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Corollary: The intersection of a closed set and a compact set is compact.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> The compact set is closed.  Intersections of closed sets are closed.  Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: For compact sets, finitely intersecting is sufficient for intersecting.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Expalantion:</i> If \(\{K_\alpha\}\) is any collection of compact sets, the theorem claims that if every finite \(\{K_{\alpha_1}, ..., K_{\alpha_n}\}\) intersects then so does all of \(\{K_\alpha\}\).
          </p>
          <p>
            The theorem sounds so similar to the definition of compactness, execpt somehow stated in an opposite form.  In the definition, every infinite union of open sets has a finite subset. Here every finite intersection of compact sets entails an intersection of all compact sets ... stated very roughly, in order to highlight the parallels.  It sure feels like somehow one is the same as the other just using De Morgan's to flip open sets to closed and unions to intersections.
          </p>
          <p>
            To argue by contradiction we assume that the intersection is empty.  That must mean that if we pick any set, call it \(K_1\in \{K_\alpha\}\), each of the elements of \(K_1\) must be lacking in some other set.  Well that means that for each element, there exists a \(K_\alpha^c\) which contains it and is open.  This is shaping up to be an open cover, from which we select a finite subcover.  From which we can get a contradiction with the fininte intersecting property.

        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation: </i> Because each set in the chain is non-empty, any finite intersection is just equal to the last set, which is non-empty.  That means this has the finite intersection property, so apply the previous result.

            <i>Explanation:</i> For proof by contradiction, if every point is not a limit point then this entails the existence of a neighborhood around each point.  This infinite collection covers but no finite subcover does.

          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> The similarity to the corollary above is striking.  In fact, in a few theorems down we'll learn that every <i>k</i>-cell is compact, and in this case (i.e. for \(\mathbb R^1\)) a <i>k</i>-cell just is an interval.  So this really is a special case of the earlier corollary.

          <p>
            Still Rudin gives a direct proof and maybe it's worth understanding that.  In fact the trick of the proof is semi-famous: we investigate the sup of the left endpoints of the interval.  This must be greater than all left endpoints and less than all right endpoints.

            <i>Explanation:</i> For contradiction we suppose that it is not compact, so that for some open cover, there is no finite subcover.  The fundamental intuition here is that, if you take any finite subcover it must not cover some part of the <i>k</i>-cell.  In fact, if we evenly sub-divide the <i>k</i>-cell, some one of these subdivisions must not be finitely subcoverable (for if they all could be, then the whole of them could be).  But if that sub-<i>k</i>-cell cannot be finitely subcovered, then we can repeat the process and get an even smaller sub-<i>k</i>-cell, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way we generate a descending chain of <i>k</i>-cells.  We apply the previous result to find a point in their intersection.  This point must be inside some open set in the open cover.  From there we are in a good position to argue that some one of the <i>k</i>-cells which we showed is not finitely subcovered, is also covered by this one open set.

            <i>Explanation:</i> Even in general metric spaces, compactness is not equivalent to being closed and bounded.  But in \(\mathbb R^k\) they are equivalent and we'll start by showing this.  First, we already know compactness entails closedness.  All that remains for this direction is to show that compactness entails boundedness.  But for contradiction, if a set were both compact and unbounded, we could find an infinite sequence of points with no limit point, contradicting an earlier theorem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>That any closed and bounded set must be compact:</i> Suppose <i>K</i> is any closed, bounded subset of \(\mathbb R^k\).  Since it's bounded it fits in a <i>k</i>-cell, and closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>That compactness entails that every infinite subset has a limit point in the set</i>: This is the content of a theorem earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>If every infinite subset has a limit point in the set then it's closed and bounded:</i>  Let <i>E</i> be any set with the following property:  If \(F\subseteq E\) and <i>F</i> is infinite, then there is a limit point of <i>F</i> in <i>E</i>.  The theorem claims that therefore <i>E</i> is closed and bounded. We do both by contradiction.  Bounded is easier so we start with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Bounded:</i> If the set is unbounded then we make a sequence of points going to infinity, and the limit of this sequence clearly isn't in the set.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Closed:</i> If it's not closed then there is a point which is a limit point but not in the set.  Then construct a sequence converging to the point.  This sequence cannot have any other limit point, easy to prove that.  And so on.

    <h2>Perfect Sets</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: Nonempty perfect sets are always uncountable.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Since some point is a limit point, then it has infinitely many points.  To show that it's uncountable, we assume for contradiction it's countable.  So of course assume \(\vec x_1, \vec x_2, ...\) is an enumeration.  Start by finding a neighborhood \(V_1\) around \(\vec x_1\).  What contradiction are we driving toward?  We can build a descending chain with no intersection.  To that end, construct a neighborhood that <i>excludes</i> \(\vec x_1\) and fits inside \(V_1\).  Then take its closure.  And so on, constructing neighborhoods that avoid all the other points.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we know we can get this \(V_2\)?  Since \(\vec x_1\) is a limit point we can find an \(\vec x_i\) inside \(V_1\) and fit an obvious ball around that.

    <h3>Theorem: Every interval of positive length is uncountable.</h3>
    <div class="sol">

        <i>Explanation: </i> Take the closure of any interval of positive length, it's perfect.

        The <b>Cantor set</b> is constructed by \(E_1 = \left[0,\frac 1 3\right]\cup \left[\frac 2 3, 1\right]\) and then \(E_2\) removes the middle third of the left and right parts of \(E_1\), and so on with \(E_3, E_4, ...\)  Then the Cantor set is \(\displaystyle P = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n\).  Clearly <i>P</i> is bounded, and arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed, so <i>P</i> is compact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rudin claims that showing <i>P</i> is perfect is implied by showing it has no isolated points.  This is because limit points are precisely those points which are not isolated points.  To show that <i>P</i> has no isolated points, if \(x\in P\) then \(x\in E_n\) for some <i>n</i>.  Then \(x\in I_n\) where \(I_n\) is the interval of \(E_n\) which contains <i>x</i>.  For any neighborhood of <i>x</i> we can find an <i>n</i> large enough such that \(I_n\) fits inside, and then take the endpoints of \(I_n\).

    <h2>Connected Sets</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are <b>separated</b> if both \(A\cap\overline B\) and \(\overline A \cap B\) are empty. A set <i>E</i> is connected if it is not the union of two separated sets.
      </p>
      <h3>Theorem: A set of real numbers is connected if and only if it contains every intermediate point.</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Explanation: </i> If it did not contain some intermediate point then this could be used as a "point of separation".  Take the part of it to the left of the absent point, the part to the right, and show these are separated sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if the set is separated, then we can take any two points and construct a gap between them.  In particular, if the set is separated into <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> then pick \(x\in A\) and \(y\in B\).  Without loss of generality, we suppose <i>x < y</i>.  What is the gap between them?  \(z = \sup (A\cap [x,y])\) is a good start, especially if we luck out and have \(z \not \in A\).  The hard part is if \(z\in A\).
