    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h1>Continuity</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h2>Limits of Functions</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        We suppose we have metric spaces <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, and \(f:X\rightarrow Y\).  <i>q</i> is the <b>limit of the function</b> <i>f</i> at <i>p</i> if \( (\forall \varepsilon\in\mathbb R^+)(\exists \delta\in\mathbb R^+)(\forall x\in X) \) we have

        $$ d(x,p) <\delta \Longrightarrow d(f(x),q) < \varepsilon $$
      </p>
      <h3>Theorem: The limit of a function at a point is the same as the limit of function values, on any sequence of domain values converging to the correct point.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> The theorem claims that  \(\displaystyle\lim_{x\rightarrow p}f(x) = q\) if and only if for every \(p_n\rightarrow p\) we have

          $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(p_n) = q $$
        </p>
        <p>
          The proof going left-to-right takes any \(\varepsilon\in\mathbb R^+\) and finds a \(\delta\).  But by the convergence of \(P_n\) we can find an <i>N</i> corresponding to \(\delta\).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the right-to-left direction, we prove the contrapositive and suppose there is some \(\varepsilon\in\mathbb R^+\) for which every \(\delta\in\mathbb R^+\) does what it does.  We can then build a specific sequence of \(\delta\)s like \(\delta_n = 1/n\) to construct a sequence converging to <i>p</i> but the function values staying out of range.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Corollary: Limits of functions are unique.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Since limits of sequences are unique.  Limits of functions are some limits of sequences, so they too must be unique.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Theorem: Limits of functions distribute over sums, products, and quotients.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> These all inherit from theorems about limits of sequences.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h2>Continuous Functions</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A function <i>f</i> between metric spaces is <b>continuous at <i>p</i></b> if for every neighborhood of \(f(p)\) there is a neighborhood of <i>p</i> which maps into it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: Being continuous at <i>p</i> is the same as the limit and function value agreeing at <i>p</i>.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Expalantion:</i> The only difference between the definitions of limit and continuity is the specification the function value.  When the limit point is specified to be <i>f(p)</i>, the two defintions collapse into the same.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: Compositions of continuous functions are continuous.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Expalantion:</i> More precisely the theorem states that if <i>f</i> is continuous at <i>p</i>, and <i>g</i> is continuous at <i>f(p)</i>, then the function \(h=g\circ f\) is continuous at <i>p</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let \(\varepsilon\in\mathbb R^+\) be given, get \(\delta\in\mathbb R^+\) for <i>g</i>.  Use \(\delta\) for the "\(\varepsilon\)" bound on <i>f</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: Continuous functions are precisely those which inverse-map open sets to open sets.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Suppose <i>f</i> is continuous and <i>V</i> is an open subset of the range.  We directly show that the inverse image is open by showing every point \(x\in f^{-1}(V)\) is interior.  In particular, because <i>V</i> is open, we can find an \(\varepsilon\) neighborhood of \(f(x)\), and then find a \(\delta\) neighborhood of <i>x</i> which maps into <i>V</i>.  But therefore this is a neighborhood of <i>x</i> fitting entirely inside the inverse image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose <i>f</i> inverse-maps open sets to open sets, and we show that <i>f</i> is continuous everywhere. So let \(x\in X\), and take an \(\varepsilon\) neighborhood of <i>f(x)</i>.  The inverse image is an open set, so put a neighborhood of <i>x</i> fitting inside this inverse image.  Say the radius is \(\delta\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Corollary: Continuous functions are also those which inverse-map closed sets to closed sets.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Complements of open sets are closed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: Sums, products, and quotients of complex continuous functions are continuous (except where the denominator is 0).</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> This is not very different from the analogous claim for limits of functions.  The only difference is the possibility of isolated points, but here there is nothing to prove since all functions are continuous at any isolated point.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: If \(f: X \rightarrow \mathbb R^k\) by \(f(\vec x) = (f_1(x_1), \dots, f_k(x_k))\) then <i>f</i> is continuous if and only if each component function is.  Sums and dot-products of continuous functions are continuous.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
      <p>
        <i>Explanation:</i> Suppose <i>f</i> is continuous at \(x\in X\).  Then with the \(\varepsilon,\delta\) you get, use in the codomain the fact that projections are always smaller in magnitude.  For the converse, you can either bound each component by \(\varepsilon/k\) or prove the contrapositive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second claim comes from the first and the closure of continuous functions under sums and products.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h2>Continuity and Compactness</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        A function is called <b>bounded</b> if its image is a bounded set.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Theorem: Continuous functions on a compact metric space have a compact image.</h3>
    <div class="sol">
