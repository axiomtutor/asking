    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h1>The Real and Complex Number Systems</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Some numbers, like \(\sqrt 2\) are not rational numbers--that is to say, they are not equal to any <i>p/q</i> for integers <i>p, q</i>.  However we often express them in decimals, and the more decimal places you take, the closer you are.  We need to make clear sense of "getting closer".
      </p>

      <h3>Theorem: \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational:</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation</i>: We will assume for contradiction there are \(p,q\in \mathbb Z\) such that \((p/q)^2 = 2\).  How do we get a contradiction?  You might notice that the right-hand side has one factor of two.  But the left-hand side has a square, and this forces either zero factors of two, or two factors of two.  The division makes this not utterly obvious, but let's try to chase down that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to most easily discuss factors, let's assume that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are coprime (so that they have the least number of factors and still satisfy the equation).  At this point you might even guess that the contradiction will come from showing that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> both have a factor of 2 (since they wouldn't then be coprime).  This guess would be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Rearrange the equation into

          $$ p^2 = 2 q^2 $$

          so that we can more directly speak about factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          p <i> has a factor of 2: </i> The RHS (right-hand side) has a factor of 2, so the LHS does.  But since \(p^2\) has a factor of 2, then <i>p</i> does.
        </p>
        <p>
          q <i>has a factor of 2:</i> Since <i>p</i> has a factor of 2, in fact \(p^2\) must have two factors of 2.  From here showing that <i>q</i> has a factor of 2 isn't hard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: There is no rational number closest to \(\sqrt 2\).</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation</i>: Let's say the theorem more explicitly.  First, define <i>A</i> to be the set of rational numbers less than \(\sqrt 2\).  Even more explicitly (and accurately)

            $$ A = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 < 2\} $$

            Note that I don't actually use the symbol \(\sqrt 2\) because at this point in the book we're not supposed to really know about irrational numbers.  So everything should be phrased in a way that makes sense only for rational numbers.  Anyway, similarly define <i>B</i> to be the set larger than \(\sqrt 2\)

            $$ B = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 > 2\} $$

            The theorem says that <i>A</i> has no largest element and <i>B</i> has no smallest.  We sketch only the proof that <i>A</i> has no greatest element.  In particular for each \(p\in A\) we construct a \(q\in A\) such that <i>p < q</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that \(p\in A\) how do we construct <i>q</i>?  First notice that if \(p\leq 0\) we can easily just pick <i>q=1</i>.  So we only need to do work for the case when <i>p > 0</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's here that I give up.  I've tried to reproduce some logic which makes no magical leaps, but I can't see how.  Therefore I find that the proof does not give any insight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover it's not necessary to give this sort of a proof.  Our hands are tied because we don't yet know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists.  But we will see the existence of real numbers, and the existence of \(\sqrt 2\), in later sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists then all we need is the existence of some positive rational \(\delta\) such that \(q = p+\delta\) satisfies \(q^2 < 2\).  And to get this \(\delta\) we just need it to be some rational number \(0 < \delta < \sqrt 2 - p\).  The existence of such a number will be guaranteed by the Archimedean property, once we get there.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h2>Ordered Sets</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        An <b>order</b> on a set <i>S</i> is a relation, denoted by <, which is "commensurate" and transitive.  An <b>upper bound</b> on a subset \(E\subseteq S\) is an element \(\beta\in S\) such that \((\forall x\in E)(x\leq \beta)\).  The <b>least upper bound</b> of <i>E</i> is also called the <b>supremum</b> of <i>E</i>.  We denote this \(\sup E\).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way we can define a lower bound and greatest lower bound.  We call the greatest lower bound the <b>infimum</b> denoted \(\inf E\).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        The entire space <i>S</i> is said to have the <b>least upper bound property</b> if every non-empty subset which has an upperbound has a least upperbound.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: If a space has the least upper-bound property then it also has the greatest lower-bound property.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Of course you have to define what the greatest lower-bound property is in a way that mirrors the least upper-bound property.  Now take any non-empty subset of <i>S</i> with a lower bound, call it <i>B</i>. We need to show it has an inf.  What can we pick for its inf?
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we know that <i>S</i> has the least upper-bound property we need to use that.  If you draw a random set of points on the numberline which is bounded below, so that this is a picture of <i>B</i>, then notice that <i>B</i> acts like an upper-bound on the half of the real line which is below <i>B</i>.  On that set, we can use the least upper-bound property.  We then argue that this least upper-bound is (inf B), which should make intuitive sense in the real number line picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Let <i>L</i> be the set of lower-bounds of <i>B</i>, i.e.

          $$ L = \{x\in S: \forall y \in B, x\leq y\} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          We show \(\sup L = \inf B\) by first showing \(\sup L\) is a lower-bound and then that it is the greatest lower-bound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>That \(\sup L\) lower-bounds </i> B:  Let \(x\in B\), we need to show \(\sup L \leq x\).  This must be true because if \(\sup L > x\) then <i>x</i> is still an upper-bound of <i>L</i> but smaller than the least upper-bound ... a contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            That \(\sup L\) is the greatest of all lower-bounds of
          </i> B: Usually we argue that if <i>y</i> is a lower bound then \(y\leq \sup L\).  Here it will be easier to argue the contrapositive, so suppose \(y > \sup L\) and we show that <i>y</i> is not a lower-bound.  If \(y>\sup L\) then <i>y</i> cannot be an upper-bound on <i>L</i>, from which the rest follows easily.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h2>Fields</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>field</b> is any set with operations that satisfy the field axioms.  These include closure, commutativity, associativity, an additive 0 and inverse, a multiplicative 1 and inverse, and distributivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this follows several properties.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Theorem: The cancelation law holds.
      </h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> By that I mean

            $$ x+y = x+z \quad \Rightarrow y = z $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof just goes by adding the additive inverse of <i>x</i> on the left of both sides.  Technically this requires some use of use of the associative law.
          </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: If adding <i>y</i> does nothing then <i>y = 0.</i></h3>
      <p class="sol">
        Same proof as before.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Theorem: <i>-(-x) = x</i>.
      </h3>
      <p class="sol">
        <i>Explanation</i>: By definition <i>-(-x)</i> is the number which when added to <i>-x</i> sums to 0.  Of course <i>x</i> has this property.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Similar other properties and their proofs hold for multiplication and so on.  Exercising these ideas is good practice but the end result is primarily that fields work like you expect numbers to work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Beyond the field axioms we also have <b>ordered field</b> axioms.  These say that < respects addition and positive multiplication.  Again they imply common facts about inequalities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h2>The Real Field</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        We assume without proof that there exists an ordered field with the least upper-bound property, and call it <b>the real numbers</b>, denoted \(\mathbb R\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Archimedean Property Part 1:  For every two positive real numbers, there is an integer multiple of the smaller which makes it larger.</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Formally the theorem claims that \(\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\) if <i>0 < x < y</i> then \(\exists n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(nx > y\).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can think of it this way: Mark <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> on the real line with <i>x</i> before <i>y</i>.  Add <i>x</i> to itself over and over.  Eventually it has to cross to the other side of <i>y</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To formalize this we need to phrase the problem in terms that can be solved by the least upper-bound property.  Since <i>y</i> acts like some kind of upper-bound, you could imagine it might be useful to use it as an upper-bound on the set of all possible <i>nx</i>.  Since we know it actually doesn't upper-bound this set and that's the whole point, then maybe we can accomplish this proof in the form of a proof by contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof idea:</i> For contradiction suppose that <i>y</i> is an upper-bound on \(\{nx: n\in \mathbb{Z}^+\}\).  Of course apply the least upper-bound property, call this \(\alpha\).  Now intuitively we're taking "steps of size <i>x</i>" and in any step of size <i>x</i> there must be one of these integral multiples of <i>x</i>.  Draw it out and you should be able to convince yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          To formalize this idea, we take a step of size <i>x</i>, going down from \(\alpha\).  Formally this means we consider \(\alpha - x\).  Now notice that since this is smaller than the smallest upper-bound, then \(\alpha - x\) can't be an upper-bound.  But that means some element of the set is larger than it.  That means there is some

          $$ \alpha - x < mx $$

          Group the <i>x</i>s together and derive a contradiction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Archimedean Property Part 2: The rationals are dense in the reals.</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Said more explicitly, \(\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\) if we have <i>x < y</i> then \(\exists p \in \mathbb Q\) such that <i>x < p < y</i>.  
        </p>
      </div>
