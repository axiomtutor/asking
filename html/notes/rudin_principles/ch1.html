    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <h1>The Real and Complex Number Systems</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Some numbers, like \(\sqrt 2\) are not rational numbers--that is to say, they are not equal to any <i>p/q</i> for integers <i>p, q</i>.  However we often express them in decimals, and the more decimal places you take, the closer you are.  We need to make clear sense of "getting closer".  This chapter will develop several ideas which allow us to rigorously discus the idea of approximation by converging sequeneces.
      </p>

      <h3>Theorem: \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational:</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation</i>: We will assume for contradiction there are \(p,q\in \mathbb Z\) such that \((p/q)^2 = 2\).  How do we get a contradiction?  You might notice that the right-hand side has one factor of two.  But the left-hand side has a square, and this forces either zero factors of two, or two factors of two.  The division makes this not utterly obvious, but let's try to chase down that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to most easily discuss factors, let's assume that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are coprime (so that they have the least number of factors and still satisfy the equation).  At this point you might even guess that the contradiction will come from showing that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> both have a factor of 2 (since they wouldn't then be coprime).  This guess would be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Rearrange the equation into

          $$ p^2 = 2 q^2 $$

          so that we can more directly speak about factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          p <i> has a factor of 2: </i> The RHS (right-hand side) has a factor of 2, so the LHS does.  But since \(p^2\) has a factor of 2, then <i>p</i> does.
        </p>
        <p>
          q <i>has a factor of 2:</i> Since <i>p</i> has a factor of 2, in fact \(p^2\) must have two factors of 2.  From here showing that <i>q</i> has a factor of 2 isn't hard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: There is no rational number closest to \(\sqrt 2\).</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation</i>: Let's say the theorem more explicitly.  First, define <i>A</i> to be the set of rational numbers less than \(\sqrt 2\).  Even more explicitly (and accurately)

            $$ A = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 < 2\} $$

            Note that I don't actually use the symbol \(\sqrt 2\) in this defintion.  That's because at this point in the book we're not supposed to really know about irrational numbers.  So everything should be phrased in a way that makes sense only for rational numbers.  Anyway, similarly define <i>B</i> to be the set larger than \(\sqrt 2\)

            $$ B = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 > 2\} $$

            The theorem says that <i>A</i> has no largest element and <i>B</i> has no smallest.  We sketch only the proof that <i>A</i> has no greatest element.  In particular for each \(p\in A\) we construct a \(q\in A\) such that <i>p < q</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that \(p\in A\) how do we construct <i>q</i>?  First notice that if \(p\leq 0\) we can easily just pick <i>q=1</i>.  So we only need to do work for the case when <i>p > 0</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's here that I give up.  I've tried to reproduce some logic which makes no magical leaps, but I can't see how.  Therefore I find that the proof does not give any insight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover it's not necessary to give this sort of a proof.  Our hands are tied because we don't yet know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists.  But we will see the existence of real numbers, and the existence of \(\sqrt 2\), in later sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists then all we need is the existence of some positive rational \(\delta\) such that \(q = p+\delta\) satisfies \(q^2 < 2\).  And to get this \(\delta\) we just need it to be some rational number \(0 < \delta < \sqrt 2 - p\).  The existence of such a number will be guaranteed by the Archimedean property, once we get there.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h2>Ordered Sets</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        An <b>order</b> on a set <i>S</i> is a relation, denoted by <, which is "commensurate" and transitive.  An <b>upper bound</b> on a subset \(E\subseteq S\) is an element \(\beta\in S\) such that \((\forall x\in E)(x\leq \beta)\).  The <b>least upper bound</b> of <i>E</i> is also called the <b>supremum</b> of <i>E</i>.  We denote this \(\sup E\).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way we can define a lower bound and greatest lower bound.  We call the greatest lower bound the <b>infimum</b> denoted \(\inf E\).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        The entire space <i>S</i> is said to have the <b>least upper bound property</b> if every non-empty subset which has an upperbound has a least upperbound.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: If a space has the least upper-bound property then it also has the greatest lower-bound property.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Of course you have to define what the greatest lower-bound property is in a way that mirrors the least upper-bound property.  Now take any non-empty subset of <i>S</i> with a lower bound, call it <i>B</i>. We need to show it has an inf.  What can we pick for its inf?
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we know that <i>S</i> has the least upper-bound property we need to use that.  If you draw a random set of points on the numberline which is bounded below, so that this is a picture of <i>B</i>, then notice that <i>B</i> acts like an upper-bound on the half of the real line which is below <i>B</i>.  On that set, we can use the least upper-bound property.  We then argue that this least upper-bound is (inf B), which should make intuitive sense in the real number line picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Let <i>L</i> be the set of lower-bounds of <i>B</i>, i.e.

          $$ L = \{x\in S: \forall y \in B, x\leq y\} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          We show \(\sup L = \inf B\) by first showing \(\sup L\) is a lower-bound and then that it is the greatest lower-bound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>That \(\sup L\) lower-bounds </i> B:  Let \(x\in B\), we need to show \(\sup L \leq x\).  This must be true because if \(\sup L > x\) then <i>x</i> is still an upper-bound of <i>L</i> but smaller than the least upper-bound ... a contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            That \(\sup L\) is the greatest of all lower-bounds of
          </i> B: Usually we argue that if <i>y</i> is a lower bound then \(y\leq \sup L\).  Here it will be easier to argue the contrapositive, so suppose \(y > \sup L\) and we show that <i>y</i> is not a lower-bound.  If \(y>\sup L\) then <i>y</i> cannot be an upper-bound on <i>L</i>, from which the rest follows easily.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h2>Fields</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        A <b>field</b> is any set with operations that satisfy the field axioms.  These include closure, commutativity, associativity, an additive 0 and inverse, a multiplicative 1 and inverse, and distributivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this follows several properties.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Theorem: The cancelation law holds.
      </h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> By that I mean

            $$ x+y = x+z \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = z $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof just goes by adding the additive inverse of <i>x</i> on the left of both sides.  Technically this requires some use of use of the associative law.
          </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Theorem: If adding <i>y</i> does nothing then <i>y = 0.</i></h3>
      <p class="sol">
        Same proof as before.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Theorem: <i>-(-x) = x</i>.
      </h3>
      <p class="sol">
        <i>Explanation</i>: By definition <i>-(-x)</i> is the number which when added to <i>-x</i> sums to 0.  Of course <i>x</i> has this property.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Similar other properties and their proofs hold for multiplication and so on.  Exercising these ideas is good practice but the end result is primarily that fields work like you expect numbers to work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Beyond the field axioms we also have <b>ordered field</b> axioms.  These say that < respects addition and positive multiplication.  Again they imply common facts about inequalities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h2>The Real Field</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        We assume without proof that there exists an ordered field with the least upper-bound property, and call it <b>the real numbers</b>, denoted \(\mathbb R\).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Archimedean Property Part 1:  For every two positive real numbers, there is an integer multiple of the smaller which makes it larger.</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation:</i> Formally the theorem claims that \(\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\) if <i>0 < x < y</i> then \(\exists n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(nx > y\).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can think of it this way: Mark <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> on the real line with <i>x</i> before <i>y</i>.  Add <i>x</i> to itself over and over.  Eventually it has to cross to the other side of <i>y</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To formalize this argument we need to phrase the problem in terms that can be solved by the least upper-bound property.  In the picture I just described, <i>y</i> acts like some kind of upper-bound, until it doesn't. <i>y</i> is bigger than <i>x</i> and maybe bigger than <i>2x</i>, and maybe bigger than <i>3x</i>, and so on.  Eventually one of these becomes bigger than <i>y</i>, but up until that point <i>y</i> is acting like an upper-bound. So let's maybe assume that <i>y</i> is an upper-bound and derive a contradiction.  After all, by assuming it's an upper-bound we then get to use the least upper-bound property.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof idea:</i> For contradiction suppose that <i>y</i> is an upper-bound on \(\{nx: n\in \mathbb{Z}^+\}\).  Of course apply the least upper-bound property, and call the sup \(\alpha\).  Now intuitively, there should be some <i>mx</i> in between \(\alpha-x\) and \(\alpha\) because the distance between them is <i>x</i>.  Draw it out and you should be able to convince yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for the formal argument that there must be some <i>mx</i> between \(\alpha-x\) and \(\alpha\): Notice that since \(\alpha-x\) is smaller than the smallest upper-bound (\(\alpha\)), then \(\alpha - x\) can't be an upper-bound.  But that means some element of the set is larger than it.  That means there is some

          $$ \alpha - x < mx $$

          Group the <i>x</i>s together and derive a contradiction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Archimedean Property Part 2: The rationals are dense in the reals.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> Said more explicitly, \(\forall r,s\in \mathbb{R}\) if we have <i>r < s</i> then \(\exists p \in \mathbb Q\) such that <i>r < p < s</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What geometrically makes sense here is to use the distance between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>, which is <i>s - r</i>.  If we can find a rational number <i>0 < q < s-r</i> then by adding <i>q</i> over and over, eventually one of these integral multiples should land inside the interval between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>.  Drawing the picture on the real line should help to see this.
          </p>
          <p>
            So then the question is how do we find this rational <i>q</i>?  First let's note that we can choose a particularly simple <i>q</i>, namely \(q = \frac{1}{a}\) for some \(a\in\mathbb Z^+\).  Because intuitively we should be able to make <i>1/a</i> as small as we need, by picking <i>a</i> as big as we need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to get

            $$ 0 < \frac 1 a < s - r $$

            or

            $$ 0 < 1 < a(s-r) $$

            we can invoke the part 1 of the Archimedean property.  In that theorem we are choosing <i>x = 1</i>, and <i>y = s-r</i>.  The <i>n</i> which the theorem tells us exists, is the <i>a</i> that we wanted to obtain.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now that we know there is some \(\frac 1 a < s - r\), the plan was to use it by adding it repeatedly until one of these lands inside the interval between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>.  We again invoke part 1 of the Archimedean property this time with <i>x = 1/a</i> and <i>y = r</i>, so that we get some \(r < \frac{b}{a} \).  The problem is that we don't know if \(s < \frac b a \).
          </p>
          <p>
            To make sure we choose something both bigger than <i>r</i> and smaller than <i>s</i> we need to choose the <i>first</i> \(\frac b a \) which is over <i>r</i>.  That means \(\frac{b-1}{a} \leq r < \frac b a \).  We can argue that such a choice exists because we know there is some \(r < \frac{b}{a}\) and in the sequence \(\frac 1 a, \frac 2 a, \dots, \frac b a\) one of these must be the first one over <i>r</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we have such a choice of <i>b/a</i> we can argue that it is less than <i>s</i>.  That's because \(\frac 1 a < s - r\) so therefore

             $$ \frac{b-1}{a} \leq r $$

             implies

             $$ \frac b a - \frac 1 a \leq r $$

             so

             $$ \frac b a - (s-r) \leq r $$

             and with easy rearrangements from here, you get the desired result.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: <i>n</i>th roots of positive reals exist and are unique.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation: </i>Said explicitly, for each real <i>x > 0</i> and \(n\in\mathbb Z^+\) there is a unique positive real <i>y</i> such that \(y^n = x\).
          </p>
          <p>
            The "uniqueness" part is the easiest to prove so we deal with that first and quickly.  If there were two distinct <i>y</i>s, then take the <i>n</i>th power of both and these will also be distinct, so they can't both equal <i>x</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now for the existence part.  Of course the main tool we've been using for existence is the least upper-bound property so we want to find some non-empty set bounded above which would relate to this problem.  It's not too hard to imagine that what we want is

            $$ E = \{ t^n: t \in \mathbb R^+, \text{ and } t^n < x \}$$
          </p>
          <p>
            We first need to show that it's non-empty.  If \(x\leq 1\) then taking <i>n</i>th powers makes \(t^n \leq t\). So in this case all we have to do is take any <i>t < x</i>.  But if <i>x > 1</i> then we could pick <i>t = 1</i>, so in every case we see that the set is non-empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we need to show it's bounded above.  But trivially it's bounded above by <i>x</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now we know it has a sup, and we claim that this sup is the <i>y</i> that we seek.  To show that \(y^n = x\) we should that it cannot possibly be greater or less than <i>x</i>.  Intuitively, by assuming \(y^n < x\) this means there is some "gap" between them, and we try to exploit that gap to show that <i>y</i> wasn't really the sup, which would be our contradiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            And similar to earlier proofs, we'll try to find some small positive <i>h</i> such that \((y+h)^n < x\).  That would then mean that would then mean that \(y+h\in E\) and so \(y+h\leq y\), contradicting \(y < y+h\).  So the question now is, what is the <i>h</i>?
          </p>
          <p>
            We know we need an <i>h</i> such that

            $$ (y+h)^n < x $$

            From \(y^n < x\) we get \(0 < x-y^n\) so we might find it useful to subtract \(y^n\) on both sides.

            $$ (y+h)^n - y^n < x-y^n $$
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point we can invoke the binomial identity

            $$ \frac{b^n-a^n}{b-a} = b^{n-1} + ab^{n-2} + \dots + a^{n-1} $$

            so that we can now say

            $$(y+h)^n - y^n = ((y+h)-y)((y+h)^{n-1} + y(y+h)^{n-2} + \dots + y^{n-1}) $$
            $$ = h((y+h)^{n-1} + y(y+h)^{n-2} + \dots + y^{n-1})$$

            and in fact if we replace each <i>y</i> with <i>y+h</i> then we get the inequality

            $$ (y+h)^n-y^n < hn(y+h)^{n-1} $$
          </p>
          <p>
            If we can make \(hn(y+h)^{n-1} < x-y^n\) with an appropriate choice of <i>h</i> we'll be done.  The <i>h</i> inside the parentheses complicates the matter.  But it should be possible to find an <i>h</i> less than 1 which satisfies this requirement, since all we really need is a "very small" <i>h</i>.  Requiring it to be less than 1 is either no impossition if <i>h</i> was already less than 1; or it only picks a smaller <i>h</i> than we needed to pick.  But if any <i>h</i> works, then any number smaller than it also works.
          </p>
          <p>
            So agreeing that we'll pick <i>h < 1</i>, we then need to pick <i>h</i> subject to the constraint that

            $$ hn(y+1)^{n-1} < x -y^n$$

            But obviously this entails the choice

            $$ h < \frac{x-y^n}{n(y+1)^{n-1}} $$
          </p>
          <p>
            With all this setup, the proof that \((y+h)^n < x\) is easy, you just grind through calculations and approximations already explained above.
          </p>
          <p>
            It still remains for us to show that \(y^n > x\) entails a contradiction, and to do that we will use the gap to show that there is a value smaller than <i>y</i> which upper-bounds <i>E</i>.  Which contradicts that <i>y</i> is the sup.  In particular we will find a <i>k</i> such that <i>y-k</i> is still an upper bound of <i>E</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To construct <i>k</i> we need to be able to take any \(t\in E\) and show \(t \leq y-k\).  But actually we will show the contrapositive: if \(t > y-k\) then \(t\not\in E\).  In fact that means, if <i>t > y-k</i> then \(t^n > x\).
          </p>
          <p>
            To show \(t^n > x\) again we subtract \(y^n\)

            $$ t^n-y^n > x-y^n $$

            and to obtain this we require a choice of <i>k</i> such that

            $$t^n-y^n > (y-k)^n - y^n > kny^{n-1}$$

            using the binomial as before, replacing this time the <i>y+k</i> with <i>y</i> so that we get smaller values.  Similar to last time, set this larger than <i>x</i> and solve for <i>k</i>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          As a quick note, it is at this point where we could revisit the proof that there is no closest number to \(\sqrt 2\) if we wanted.  We know that <i>n</i>th roots exist now, and we know the Archimedean property.

        <p class="sol">
          To show \((ab)^{1/n} = a^{1/n}b^{1/n}\) we merely need to see that \((a^{1/n}b^{1/n})^n = ab\) and that follows from the distributivity of integer powers.

        As a note, the decimal representation of a real number is

        $$ x = n_0. n_1 n_2 \dots $$

        where \(n_0\in\mathbb{Z}\) and each \(n_i\in [9]\).  The notation \(n_0.n_1n_2\dots\) means

        $$n_0 + \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{n_i}{10^i}$$

        and each \(n_i\) is chosen maximally for each finite truncation.

        <p>
          The <b>extended real number system</b> is the real numbers with symbols added for \(+\infty\) and \(-\infty\).  The uncontroversial laws, like a finite plus and infinite number is infinite, are accepted.

    <h2>The Complex Field</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          The <b>complex numbers</b> is the set of all pairs of real numbers, which we can denote either \((a,b)\) or equivalently \(a+ib\), together with the rules for addition and multiplication which are what you'd get from treating <i>i</i> like a number such that \(i^2=-1\).

        <h3>Theorem: The complex numbers form a field.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            The confirmation of this fact is mostly straight-forward and tedious.  The only significant task is showing that complex numbers have multiplicative inverses (use the <b>conjugate</b> \(\overline{a+ib}=a-ib \)).  Real numbers themselves form a subfield as the projection on the first coordinate.

          Several basic theorems about how complex numbers work are all easily proved.  We define the <b>absolute value</b> of a complex number <i>z</i> to be \(|z| = \sqrt{z\overline z}\).  It satisfies properties that are like the "distance from the origin in the complex plane".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: The absolute value is positive and only equal to zero if the complex number is.  The conjugate has the same absolute value.  Absolute value distributes over multiplication.  Real and imaginary projections have smaller absolute value.  The triangle inequality.</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation:</i> The only one of these that's hard to prove is the triangle inequality.  We use the definition in terms of the conjugate, and then distribute. We want to rearrange this into the expression we'd get if we also distributed \((|z|+|w|)^2\) but we are hindered by the middle terms.  (If you are tempted to write out <i>z</i> or <i>w</i> in terms of their components, don't.  This will get you lost in a sea of symbols and it's unnecessary.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The important observation at this point is that \(z\overline w + \overline z w \) is actually just twice the real part of \(z\overline w\).  If we call the real part of any complex number \(\Re (a+bi) = a\) then this means \(z\overline w + \overline z w = 2\Re (z\overline w)\).  Then observe that the real part can be "rounded up" to \(|z\overline w|\), which can then be rearranged into \( (|z|+|w|)^2\).

            Of course we use summation notation \(\displaystyle x_1+x_2+...+x_n = \sum_{j=1}^n x_j\).
