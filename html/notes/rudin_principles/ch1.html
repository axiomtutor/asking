    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Some numbers, like \(\sqrt 2\) are not rational numbers--that is to say, they are not equal to any <i>p/q</i> for integers <i>p, q</i>.  However we often express them in decimals, and the more decimal places you take, the closer you are.  We need to make clear sense of "getting closer".
      </p>

      <h3>Theorem: \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational:</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation</i>: We will assume for contradiction there are \(p,q\in \mathbb Z\) such that \((p/q)^2 = 2\).  How do we get a contradiction?  You might notice that the right-hand side has one factor of two.  But the left-hand side has a square, and this forces either zero factors of two, or two factors of two.  The division makes this not utterly obvious, but let's try to chase down that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to most easily discuss factors, let's assume that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are coprime (so that they have the least number of factors and still satisfy the equation).  At this point you might even guess that the contradiction will come from showing that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> both have a factor of 2 (since they wouldn't then be coprime).  This guess would be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Rearrange the equation into

          $$ p^2 = 2 q^2 $$

          so that we can more directly speak about factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          p <i> has a factor of 2: </i> The RHS (right-hand side) has a factor of 2, so the LHS does.  But since \(p^2\) has a factor of 2, then <i>p</i> does.
        </p>
        <p>
          q <i>has a factor of 2:</i> Since <i>p</i> has a factor of 2, in fact \(p^2\) must have two factors of 2.  From here showing that <i>q</i> has a factor of 2 isn't hard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: There is no rational number closest to \(\sqrt 2\).</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation</i>: Let's say the theorem more explicitly.  First, define <i>A</i> to be the set of rational numbers less than \(\sqrt 2\).  Even more explicitly (and accurately)

            $$ A = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 < 2\} $$

            and similarly define <i>B</i> to be the set larger than \(\sqrt 2\)

            $$ B = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 > 2\} $$

            The theorem says that <i>A</i> has no largest element and <i>B</i> has no smallest.  We sketch only the proof that <i>A</i> has no greatest element.  In particular for each \(p\in A\) we construct a \(q\in A\) such that <i>p < q</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that \(p\in A\) how do we construct <i>q</i>?  First notice that if \(p\leq 0\) we can easily just pick <i>q=1</i>.  So we only need to do work for the case when <i>p > 0</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rudin found a <i>q</i> that works, but he gives no explanation for how he found it.  He tells us

            $$ q = p + \frac{2-p^2}{p+2} $$
          </p>
          <p>
            This <i>q</i> is <i>p</i> plus a positive number so clearly <i>p < q</i>.  But how did he choose this extra positive quantity?  It certainly guarantees that \(q^2 < 2\), so somehow he built it to satisfy this inequality.  But you would never have come up with it on your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you tried to come up with it on your own a reasonable attempt would be to say "Let's take <i>p</i> and add some positive \(\delta\) to get <i>q</i>.  That is to say, assume \(q = p+\delta\) and then plug this into the equation \(q^2 < 2\) and see what this tells us about \(\delta\)."
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately it doesn't tell you as much as you would like.

            $$ q^2 < 2 \Leftrightarrow (p+\delta)^2 < 2 \Leftrightarrow $$
            $$ p^2 + 2p\delta + \delta^2 < 2 $$
          </p>
          <p>
            You could rearrange this and try to do some kind of solution for \(\delta\).  In fact when I did it, I eventually arrived at

            $$\delta < \frac{2-p^2}{2p+\delta}$$
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a little tantilizing beacuse it looks nearly like what Rudin got.  Still, having \(\delta\) on both sides of the inequation makes it hard to know exactly what we should do.
