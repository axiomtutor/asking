    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div>
      <p>
        Some numbers, like \(\sqrt 2\) are not rational numbers--that is to say, they are not equal to any <i>p/q</i> for integers <i>p, q</i>.  However we often express them in decimals, and the more decimal places you take, the closer you are.  We need to make clear sense of "getting closer".
      </p>

      <h3>Theorem: \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational:</h3>
      <div class="sol">
        <p>
          <i>Explanation</i>: We will assume for contradiction there are \(p,q\in \mathbb Z\) such that \((p/q)^2 = 2\).  How do we get a contradiction?  You might notice that the right-hand side has one factor of two.  But the left-hand side has a square, and this forces either zero factors of two, or two factors of two.  The division makes this not utterly obvious, but let's try to chase down that idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to most easily discuss factors, let's assume that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are coprime (so that they have the least number of factors and still satisfy the equation).  At this point you might even guess that the contradiction will come from showing that <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> both have a factor of 2 (since they wouldn't then be coprime).  This guess would be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Proof outline:</i> Rearrange the equation into

          $$ p^2 = 2 q^2 $$

          so that we can more directly speak about factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          p <i> has a factor of 2: </i> The RHS (right-hand side) has a factor of 2, so the LHS does.  But since \(p^2\) has a factor of 2, then <i>p</i> does.
        </p>
        <p>
          q <i>has a factor of 2:</i> Since <i>p</i> has a factor of 2, in fact \(p^2\) must have two factors of 2.  From here showing that <i>q</i> has a factor of 2 isn't hard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Theorem: There is no rational number closest to \(\sqrt 2\).</h3>
        <div class="sol">
          <p>
            <i>Explanation</i>: Let's say the theorem more explicitly.  First, define <i>A</i> to be the set of rational numbers less than \(\sqrt 2\).  Even more explicitly (and accurately)

            $$ A = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 < 2\} $$

            Note that I don't actually use the symbol \(\sqrt 2\) because at this point in the book we're not supposed to really know about irrational numbers.  So everything should be phrased in a way that makes sense only for rational numbers.  Anyway, similarly define <i>B</i> to be the set larger than \(\sqrt 2\)

            $$ B = \{r\in \mathbb Q: r^2 > 2\} $$

            The theorem says that <i>A</i> has no largest element and <i>B</i> has no smallest.  We sketch only the proof that <i>A</i> has no greatest element.  In particular for each \(p\in A\) we construct a \(q\in A\) such that <i>p < q</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that \(p\in A\) how do we construct <i>q</i>?  First notice that if \(p\leq 0\) we can easily just pick <i>q=1</i>.  So we only need to do work for the case when <i>p > 0</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's here that I give up.  Rudin provides a choice of <i>q</i> that works, but he gives no clue as to how he came up wtih this choice.  And I've tried to reproduce some logic which makes no magical leaps, but I can't see how.  Therefore I find that the proof does not give any insight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover it's not necessary to give this sort of a proof.  Our hands are tied because we don't yet know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists.  But we will see the existence of real numbers, and the existence of \(\sqrt 2\), in later sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we know that \(\sqrt 2\) exists then all we need is the existence of some positive rational \(\delta\) such that \(q = p+\delta\) satisfies \(q^2 < 2\).  And to get this \(\delta\) we just need it to be some rational number \(0 < \delta < \sqrt 2 - p\).  The existence of such a number will be guaranteed by the Archimedean property, once we get there.
