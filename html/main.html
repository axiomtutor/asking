        <p>Welcome to Progressing, a website devoted to the history and philosophy of Science! </p>
        
        <p>This is in the very early stages of development and almost nothing works or looks right.</p>

        <div class="zoomContent" id="content1">
          <p>This site contains a history and philosophy of Science.  The site strives for depth in that it starts from prehuman ancestors making stone tools, and terminates at modern quantum mechanics and Bayesian statistics.  It strives for breadth in developing ideas from Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Statistics, Computer Science, and Economics.  </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>First and foremost this site <b>explains what Science is and how it actually works</b>.  Too often Science is presented as facts and formulae.  This is not Science any more than a novel is identical with the last sentence on the last page.  Science is a process and the process is <i>much, much, much</i> more important than its conclusions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This site tries to <b>provide the equivalent of a university degree</b>.  Although the site may never fully reach a terminus, I hope that it will eventually contain all the information one typically encounters in a U.S. undergraduate degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, and Computer Science. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It will also contain the equivalent of some lower-level courses in Biology, Chemistry, Logic, Philosophy, Economics, and History.  
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This site will draw inferences about important social, political, and philosophical topics including: <b>evolution, climate change, abortion, artificial intelligence, vaccines, racism, and more.</b>
              </p>
            </li>

              <p>The content follows a <b>logical development</b>.</p>  
              <p>There are many good structures:  logical, chronological, biographical, social, or the typical university course structure. If the site were chronological then I would follow a strict historical timeline. If I structured this biographically then this would be a sequence of stories about the lives of people and what they discovered. I have chosen to structure this primarily on the logic of the ideas, so that no idea is discussed until it is clear how it could have come out of previous knowledge.</p> 
              <p>Where possible I try to also follow a chronological structure, and include the information contained within typical university courses.  When these conflict at all with the logical structure, I maintain the logical structure before trying to maintain the others.  But it should still be the case that, after understanding the material in these pages you will have learned all that is contained in a typical, relevant university course (and much more!).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The site uses <b>project-based and inquiry-based learning</b>.  Much of education just tells you a bunch of facts.  Only slighly better is when they tell you how to reason through a problem.  But at no point in that do you actually figure something out!  You just follow instructions which is deeply contrary to how Science works.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course you cannot be expected to re-invent all of Science without any help or resources.  But a good intermediate point is to direct you toward scientific experiments that you can conduct on your own, and then start developing scientific theories which explain them.  Rather than merely tell you the quadratic formula, I can show you the basic ideas of Algebra which were used to discover it&mdash;and then you can discover it on your own!
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                The material is <b>exercise-heavy</b>.  That means there is at least a 1:1 ratio of exercises to learning material.  For each important idea there is at least one exercise for that idea.  
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact I hope that the ratio will more often be &infin;:1.  I am developing a simple formal language that will generate random exercises so that you will have a literal infinity of chances to exercise your understanding.  And not only should it generate random exercises and their solution, but it should also algorithmically generate all of the intermediate solution steps so that you never have to be stuck on a problem!
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                I will try to make these lessons <b>modular</b>, <b>hierarchical</b>, <b>hyper-link cross-referenced</b>, and <b>portable</b>, where possible.  By modular I mean that lessons will be as self-contained as possible.  This is obviously not always possible since one cannot learn Calculus to any reasonable extent without knowing Algebra.  However I will try to make the Calculus lessons independent of the specific lessons contained in the Algebra section, so that if you already know Algebra, you can skip straight to Calculus.  I will also try to make it such that any refactoring of this material by me or anyone who contributes to the project can make changes locally that do not require large refactoring anywhere else.  To do so I'll try to divide lessons into the smallest possible conceptual components, hyperlinked both to the prerequisite concepts and to down-stream concepts.  Ideally I'd like to even design the site so that pre-requisite material can have a dedicated panel in the page, so that jumping to other pages can be kept to a minimum.  But that feature may take time for me to develop while I'm trying to build out the core content.  
              </p>
              <p>
                I will try to provide a map of the relevant concepts so that one can plan their own studies.  Don't care about Math but want to learn the Physics?  Certainly you'll need to study <i>some</i> amount of Math, and depending on how far you want to take your Physics studies you may need a <i>lot</i> of Math.  When the concept map is finished, hopefully you can trace through it learning only the components that you need for your purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                And finally, I will provide information in videos, pictures, text, and exercises.  I will try to make all of this printable and/or downloadable for offline use, in order to maximize accessibility for people with poor internet connections.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Eventually I would like to have truly <b>interactive components</b>. These will be <i>heavily</i> moderated to ensure productive, healthy, and well-intentioned community. 
                The most important will be a FAQ section on each concept.  Initially I may post questions and my own answers to those questions.  Later I would like to make this a StackExchange-styled user-question-user-answer feature.  
              </p>
              <p>
                After that I'm considering experimenting with several other styles of interactivity:  Discussion forums, chats, webcasts, study groups, meetup groups, and so on.
