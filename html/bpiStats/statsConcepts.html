    <h1>Concepts in Statistics</h1>
    <p>Here we'll discuss some of the first important ideas of statistics so that you can warm up to them early.  If all goes well, when you encounter these ideas in class everything will go more smoothly and quickly because you've seen them once before.</p>
    <h2>Population versus sample</h2>
    <p>If the world were perfect we wouldn't need statistics.  How many people will vote for a given candidate?  If we could ask every single voter, there would be no need for statistics.  We would simply count the votes right away.  But we can't ask every voter because we would have to look up their phone numbers, or for the ones who can't be reached by phone, we'd have to find out where they live and go to them.  All of that costs too much money.</p>
    <p>Instead of just collecting ALL the data, statistics tells us how to only look at a portion of the data.  Suppose we want to know if the number of hours of sleep correlates with the GPA of students.  Rather than studying all of the millions of students in the world, we can simply take a sample of maybe 30 or 100 students.  As long as we randomly select these students, they should be similar to all other students.</p>
    <p>So here is the first important concept: The <b>population</b> of study is the TOTAL set of all individuals we're trying to understand.  A <b>sample</b> is a subset of the population that we will use to learn about the population.  In the student example above, the population is the set of all students throughout the world, and perhaps even throughout all of time.  The sample is the random 30 or 100 students chosen to represent the population.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>In the following, state which is the populaton and which is the sample.
    <ol>
      <li>Nielson devices are attached to about 5000 TVs in the US.  They are trying to find out what people are watching in the US.</li>
      <li>A company produces pill capsules and the thickness of the wall of the capsule needs to be between 0.5 and 1 millimeter.  To check whether their pill capsules are within this range they collect 100 pill capsules from the manufacturing line and measure them.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Bias</h2>
    <p>The idea of selecting a "representative" sample is a great cost-saving strategy.  But you have to use it carefully.  Imagine you want to know who will win the presidential election, so you go outside and ask the first ten people you see "Who are you voting for?"  If you live in New York City probably 9 in 10 people will tell you the Democrat (even if only 8 of those 10 will actually vote for the Democrat).  If you live in Riverton, Wyoming, probably 9 in 10 will tell you the Republican.  </p>
    <p>The reason is that your sample was not collected randomly.  By collecting your sample within a certain region, you made it more likely to get certain individuals.  If you wanted a true representation of the whole US voting trend, you would need to choose people from the US <i>at random</i>, and everyone would need to have the same probability of being selected. </p>
    <p>A method of collecting your sample is called <b>biased</b> if over-represents some members of the population.  There is a particular sampling method that is guaranteed to be unbiased: Simple Random Sample or SRS for short.  The way you do SRS is to first assign a number to every single member of the population.  For instance, in the student example, you could assign a number to every single student in the world.  Then use a random number generator to select a student at random.  Then do it again and again until you've selected the number of students you want.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>For the following, say whether the sampling method could be biased.  If it could be, indicate how you would conduct an SRS instead.
      <ol>
      <li>You want to measure how many teenagers in New York City use illegal drugs, so you study students from a few different high schools in the city.</li>
      <li>You want to study the rate of infidelity in people's marriages, so you randomly select some names from the phone book and ask them if they've ever cheated in their marriage.</li>
      <li>You want to study rates of diabetes and so you select a group of patients at a local hospital.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>This is biased because kids using illegal drugs are less likely to be in school.  To conduct an SRS you would somehow need to get the names of every student in the city, assign them numbers, and use a computer (or some other device) to randomly select a number from the set.</li>
        <li>This is biased because people will definitely lie about a sensitive question like this.  Here the bias isn't in the selection of the individuals but it is biased in how you get the answers from the individuals.  To perform an SRS you would need to have a guarantee that the individual's answers would never be connected back to them.  Say you make an online form where people can type in their answer and submit anonymously.</li>
        <li>This is biased because hospitals are likely to have people there to treat their diabetes, so you're going to get an over-representation of people with diabetes.  Since you're trying to study the population of all people (or maybe all US people?) you'll need to assign every US resident a number and randomly select that number.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Convenience Sampling</h2>
    <p>
      The great thing about a well-built SRS is that it's guaranteed not to be biased.  The down-side is that you have to somehow be able to "assign every member of the population a number" and then you have to be able to go study any person you randomly select.  Often that is almost as hard and expensive as just studying the entire population.  How do you get the names and locations of every person in the US, so that you can assign them a number and then go study them.  Are you really going to find out that Buckey Finkleberg lives in Klamath Falls, Oregon as well as every other individual in the US?  Where are you going to get that information?  Once you get it, if you're trying to study their financial activities, how are you going to get that information?
    </p>
    <p>
      So SRS isn't really possible for large and difficult populations.  Therefore we need some more doable sampling methods even if they have a little more risk of bias.  The <i>WORST</i> of these is a so-called "convenience sampling" because it is often SO biased that it really isn't worth doing.  But it is very cheap.  You just grab the nearest people around you and sample them.  It is depressing how often researchers actually do this. One researcher found that about 68% of psychology research subjects were college students.  
    </p>
    <h2>Stratefied Sampling</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we are interested in the relationships between groups.  For one example, maybe we want to look at the pay difference between men and women.  Then it might make sense to "stratefy" the population into subgroups, that is to say, do a random sample of the men and then do a random sample of the women.  This guarantees that we get a good sample size for each group.  For another example, suppose you want to see how high school kids are different based on their grade levels.  So you group the freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and sample each group separately to make sure you get a good number of samples from each group.</p>
    <p>This doesn't really do anything for bias.  It's just to make sure that the different groups are each sampled enough to get useful information.</p>
