    <h1>Concepts in Statistics</h1>
    <p>Here we'll discuss some of the first important ideas of statistics so that you can warm up to them early.  If all goes well, when you encounter these ideas in class everything will go more smoothly and quickly because you've seen them once before.</p>
    <h2>Population versus sample</h2>
    <p>If the world were perfect we wouldn't need statistics.  How many people will vote for a given candidate?  If we could ask every single voter, there would be no need for statistics.  We would simply count the votes right away.  But we can't ask every voter because we would have to look up their phone numbers, or for the ones who can't be reached by phone, we'd have to find out where they live and go to them.  All of that costs too much money.</p>
    <p>Instead of just collecting ALL the data, statistics tells us how to only look at a portion of the data.  Suppose we want to know if the number of hours of sleep correlates with the GPA of students.  Rather than studying all of the millions of students in the world, we can simply take a sample of maybe 30 or 100 students.  As long as we randomly select these students, they should be similar to all other students.</p>
    <p>So here is the first important concept: The <b>population</b> of study is the TOTAL set of all individuals we're trying to understand.  A <b>sample</b> is a subset of the population that we will use to learn about the population.  In the student example above, the population is the set of all students throughout the world, and perhaps even throughout all of time.  The sample is the random 30 or 100 students chosen to represent the population.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>In the following, state which is the populaton and which is the sample.
    <ol>
      <li>Nielson devices are attached to about 5000 TVs in the US.  They are trying to find out what people are watching in the US.</li>
      <li>A company produces pill capsules and the thickness of the wall of the capsule needs to be between 0.5 and 1 millimeter.  To check whether their pill capsules are within this range they collect 100 pill capsules from the manufacturing line and measure them.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h2>Bias</h2>
    <p>The idea of selecting a "representative" sample is a great cost-saving strategy.  But you have to use it carefully.  Imagine you want to know who will win the presidential election, so you go outside and ask the first ten people you see "Who are you voting for?"  If you live in New York City probably 9 in 10 people will tell you the Democrat (even if only 8 of those 10 will actually vote for the Democrat).  If you live in Riverton, Wyoming, probably 9 in 10 will tell you the Republican.  </p>
    <p>The reason is that your sample was not collected randomly.  By collecting your sample within a certain region, you made it more likely to get certain individuals.  Because political groups tend to cluster in regions, that means you can get a sample that over-represents a certain group.  If you wanted a true representation of the whole US voting trend, you would need to choose a person from the US at random, and everyone would need to have the same probability of being selected. </p>
    <p>A method of collecting your sample is called <b>biased</b> if it has a higher probability</p>
