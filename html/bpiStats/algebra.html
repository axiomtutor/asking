    <h1>Algebra</h1>
    <h2>Writing equations</h2>
    <p>Algebra is a big subject but we really only need to focus on one thing: How to solve for a variable in a linear equation.  Take for example the puzzle: </p>
    <p>"I have a number which when you add 2 you get 7.  What is my number?" </p>
    <p> Obviously the answer is 5 but I chose a really easy example to help you see what Algebra is.  This question is the same as the Algebra problem
    $$ x+2 = 7 $$
    </p>
    <p>
      You could run into a real-life problem like this if, say, you and a friend are paying for lunch.  The bill is $25 and your friend pays $15, and you need to cover the rest.  Again the numbers are simple but it's just to keep the picture clear so that you can see the connection to the equation 
      
      $$x + 15 = 25$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's another puzzle that's harder to solve without algebra.  
    </p>
    <quote>"8 years ago, one third of my age was equal to a fifth of how old I'll be 5 years from now.  How old am I?"</quote>
    <p>You might still be able to get through this without algebra but I think algebra is just easier.  First, since we don't know the age in question, we just write it as <i>x</i> in order to be able to talk about it.  Now "8 years ago" is talking about when I was <i>x</i>-8.  So we take a third of that, which can be written as \(\frac{x-8}{3}\). </p>
    <p>Now that's equal to my age in five years, divided by 5.  We can write that as \(\frac{x+5}{5}\).  Since these two quantites are said to be equal, we write an equation.</p>
    $$\frac{x-8}{3}=\frac{x+5}{5}$$
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>Write an equation corresponding to the following sentence:</p>
    <p>"If you add three books to my bookshelf, there will be just as many books as if you removed half and added 10."</p>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>$$x+3 = \frac{x}{2}+10$$</p>
    <h2>How to solve equations (or: the art of cancelling)</h2>
    <p>Now that we've seen how equations correspond to real world questions, let's talk about how to solve them.  We're going to look at how to solve these 10 equations:

      <tr><td>1.</td><td>$$x+2=7$$</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>$$2x = 10$$</td>

        <td>$$ 2(3x-1) = 9x $$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9.</td>
        <td>$$\frac{1}{x}+1 = 2$$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10.</td>
        <td>$$\frac{2x-3}{x} = 5$$</td>
      </tr>
    </table></p>
    <p><b>In every case we're going to rely on the idea of canceling!</b> We obviously don't need it for the first two because the solution is so easy, but let's start warming up to the idea of canceling.  </p>
    <h3>Problem 1. &nbsp; \(x+2=7\)</h3>
    <p>The first principle to make clear is that <i>whatever you do to one side you must do to the other.</i>  So if I wanted to I could add 1 to both side.  It's not a <i>good</i> idea to do this, but you <i>could</i>.  It won't get you any closer to the answer.  However, if I add -2 to both sides then I will <b>cancel</b> the 2 on the left and get rid of 2.</p>
    $$x+2-2=7-2$$
    therefore
    $$x=5$$
    On the left it cancels, on the right it computes.  We'll see this pattern over and over again.  
    <h3>Problem 2. &nbsp; \(2x = 10\)</h3>
    <p>This time the idea of cancelling is a little bit different because we don't add anything.  We want to cancel the 2, but this time it's multiplied.  The thing that cancels multiplication is division, so we divide by 2.</p>
    $$2x\div 2 = 10\div 2$$
    therefore 
    $$x = 5$$
    Again it cancelled on the left and computed on the right.
    <h3>Problem 3. &nbsp; \(2x-7=11\)</h3>
    <p>This time we have a question: Which do we cancel first?  Do we cancel the -7 or the 2*?  If we try to cancel the 2* we should realize that this is a mistake.  <b>Why?</b></p>
    <p>It's very important to understand the reason: Because if you divide by 2 you have to divide the ENTIRE left side by 2.  But that doesn't just cancel because the -7 is also getting divided.  If you tried to do this it should look like this: </p>
    $$\frac{2x-7}{2}=\frac{11}{2}$$
    <p>Now this is not actually wrong.  You could get to the answer from here.  But it's harder than it has to be.  If we cancel the -7 first, that will be simpler because we can immediately cancel it.  </p>
    $$ 2x-7+7 = 11+7 $$
    therefore
    $$ 2x = 18 $$
    <p>Notice that it cancelled on the left and computed on the right.  Now we can divide by 2 to get the answer</p>
    $$\frac{2x}{2}=\frac{18}{2}$$
    therefore 
    $$x = 9$$
    <h3>Problem 4. &nbsp; \(\frac{x/2-3}{4} = 5\)</h3>
    <p>Now we have three things to choose from.  Do we cancel the /2, do we cancel the -3, or do we cancel the division by 4?  The answer is that we look for <i>the "outer-most operation"</i>.  In this case that's the division by 4.  In some sense it's the "main operation" because it's dividing everything else by 4.  So we start with that.</p>
    <p>To cancel it we multiply by 4.</p>
    <p>$$4\times \frac{x/2-3}{4}=5\times 4$$
    therefore 
      $$ x/2-3 = 20$$
    </p>
    <p>Now we have to identify the "main operation" again, and this time is the -3 because everything else is being subtracted by 3.  So to invert it we add 3.</p>
    <p>
      $$ x/2-3+3 = 20+3 $$
      therefore
      $$ x/2 = 23 $$
    </p>
    <p>Finally there's only one operation left so we invert it by multiplying by 2.</p>
    <p>
      $$2\times x/2 = 23\times 2$$
      therefore
      $$x = 46$$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 5. &nbsp; \(2x-3x+1=-10\)</h3>
    <p>This one is different.  The only important difference is <i>that there isn't just one <i>x</i> in the equation.</i>  We don't have techniques for solving when there are <i>x</i>s located in multiple places.  Therefore we have to make it so that there is just one <i>x</i>!</p>
    <p>We can do that by factoring out the <i>x</i>.  </p>
    <p>
      $$x(2-3)+1=-10$$
      therefore 
      $$x(-1)+1=-10$$
    </p>
    <p>Now we're in a situation very similar to Problem 3.  We solve it the same way, starting by cancelling the +1 and then cancelling the *(-1).</p>
    <p>
      $$x(-1)+1-1=-10-1$$
      therefore 
      $$x(-1) = -11$$
      therefore 
      $$\frac{x(-1)}{-1}=\frac{-11}{-1}$$
      therefore 
      $$x = 11$$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 6. &nbsp; \(5(x-1)-2(x+1)=10\)</h3>
    <p>Again there are many <i>x</i>s so we have to somehow put them together.  However, this time they each occur inside their own multiplication term.  Therefore we have to "break them out".  In this case that means "distributing" and then grouping them together.  </p>
    <p>
      $$ 5x-5-2x-2 = 10$$
    </p>
    <p>Now that the two terms have been distributed into 4 terms, the terms with <i>x</i>s are free to be grouped together.  </p>
    <p>
      $$5x-2x-5-2 = 10$$
      therefore
      $$x(5-2)-7=10$$
      therefore 
      $$x\times 3-7 = 10$$
      therefore 
      $$x\times 3-7+7=10+7$$
      therefore 
      $$x\times 3 = 17$$
      therefore 
      $$x\times 3/3 = 17/3$$
      therefore 
      $$x = 17/3$$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 7. &nbsp; \(2(3x-1)=22\)</h3>
    <p>
      This time there's only one <i>x</i> so we don't have to distribute or factor.  We can just cancel the main operation.  I'll stop writing "therefore" every time and I'll stop showing all of the steps of calculation.  You should be able to see which steps I'm taking.  
    </p>
    <p>
      $$2(3x-1)\div 2 = 22\div 2$$ <br>
      $$3x-1 = 11$$ <br>
      $$3x = 12$$ <br>
      $$x = 4$$
    </p>
    <h3>Problem 8. &nbsp; \(2(3x-1) = 9x\)</h3>
    <p>Again we have <i>x</i>s in many places.  This time it's a little different from the other examples because an <i>x</i> is on both sides of the equal-sign.  So we can't just distribute and move them together.  We need to somehow take one of them and move it to the other side of the equal-sign.  That's simple enough, though: Cancelling by -9<i>x</i> will do it.</p>
    <p>
      $$2(3x-1)-9x=9x-9x$$ <br>
      $$2(3x-1)-9x = 0$$
    </p>
