    <h1>Logic</h1>
    <h2>My description of what Stats is</h2>
    <p>There are many definitions of "statistics".  Mine is: It is reasoning under uncertainty. </p>
    <p>Suppose polls tell you that 51% of people support a political candidate.  Will she win?</p>
    <p>Suppose someone offers you a bet that if they throw double-sixes then you give them $100 but if not then they pay you $1. Should you take the bet?</p>
    <p>We can't know the answer, nobody can.  But some bets are smarter to make than others.  In Math we can know things with certainty: 1+1=2 always.  Stats uses math, but we use it to describe answers that are probabilistic.  Will a coin come up heads?  1/2 probability.  The mathematical value is precise but it precisely describes our uncertainty.</p>
    
    <h2>Propositions</h2>
    <p>Seen in this way, statistics is about reasoning.  So we need to get good at logic. </p>
    <p>... So what is logic?  Broadly, it's taking information and drawing conclusions.  But we'll focus on a fairly small and manageable part of logic, which deals with propositions, premises, conclusions, and inferences.</p>
    <p>Probably every textbook on Logic includes the famous example: "All men are mortal.  Socrates is a man.  Therefore Socrates is mortal." Every one of these sentences is what we call a <b>proposition</b>.  Propositions are sentences that are either true or false.  Here are some examples of sentences that are not propositions:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>What time is it?</li>
        <li>Yay!</li>
        <li>Go right.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Test your understanding:</h3>
    <p>Every time I tell you something that could come up on a test in the class, I'll try to give you one of these "test your understanding" sections.  So if you're wondering what part of these notes you can skip and what part really matters: The stuff that REALLY matters is tested in the "test your understanding" sections.</p>
    <p>So which of the following sentences are propositions and why?</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Beyonce released <i>Lemonade</i>.</li>
        <li>The stock market will go up.</li>
        <li>I don't know who the Prime Minister of Canada is.</li>
        <li>Let's go crush this stats class.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Answers:</h3>
    <p>Try not to look at the answers until you've made a real attempt to answer the questions yourself!  Being active is much better for learning than just passively reading.</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>This is a proposition. The statement is true.  (The general litmus test for whether something is a proposition is: Can we say this sentence is true or false?)</li>
        <li>This is a proposition, but it's a little less clear because <i>right now</i> we don't know whether it's true or false.  But the fact remains that it <i>is</i> true or false, we just have to wait to find out which one it is.  But it is still true or false and therefore it is a proposition.</li>
        <li>This is a proposition because it falsely states that I don't know who Justin Trudeau is.</li>
        <li>This is not a proposition, because it's a command or an exclamation.  But it does not actually make a claim that we can call true or false.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <p>We use <b>arguments</b> all the time in science.  By that I mean we start from some facts, and use those facts to reach conclusions.  An example would be:</p>
    <p>"Every time you let something go it falls to the ground.  So there must be some force pulling things toward the ground."</p>
    <p>Notice that "arguments" in this sense don't have to be angry and nobody even has to be disagreeing.  What we call "arguments" could also be called "stating our beliefs and giving reasons for those beliefs".  The arguments that we study are made up of propositions.  Some of these propositions are the <b>conclusion</b> (in the previous example that's the second sentence) or the belief.  The other propositions are the reasons, which we call <b>premises</b>.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>In the following, identify the premises and the conclusion.  There will always be one conclusion and at least one premise. Hint: You cannot assume that the conclusion always comes last.</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>The butler killed Watson.  It must have been.  We know that either the maid or the butler killed Watson.  If it was the maid, Watson was poisoned.  But Watson wasn't poisoned.</li>
        <li>If the earth is round we should be able to see the curvature.  We cannot see the curvature, so the earth must be flat. (Note: this is a bad argument, and we'll discuss why in a minute!)</li>
      </ol>
