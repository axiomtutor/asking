    <h1>Arithmetic</h1>
    <p>We're going to obviously do a lot of calculations in this class so let's make sure you recall the fundamentals, boring as it might be.</p>
    <h2>Adding all kinds of *&^#</h2>
    <p>Of course you all recall how to add 123+456 kind of stuff.  How about 1.23 + 45.6?  The key is to line up the decimal point and add like usual.  Same thing goes for subtraction.  You should test yourself to make sure you got this.  If you do it right, you should get that 1.23+45.6 is 46.83.</p>
    <p>Now how about adding negatives?  You might have forgotten this depending on how long ago your math class was and how far you went.  What is -12+3?  Step one is to determine what the sign is.  The negative is "bigger" than the positive so the answer is going to be negative.  Next, because one is positive and the other is negative they're going to cancel, not combine.  Therefore we'll take the difference of 12 and 3 which is 9.  Put it all together now and the result is -9.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>Compute the following.</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-(-4.56)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First notice the negative is larger (it's the -4.56 because subtraction is just like adding with a negative).  Since the signs are opposite we're going to cancel so we subtract.  It'll be easier to do if we put the larger number first.
          $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
           & 4. & 5 & 6
          -& 1. & 2 & 3 \\\hline
           & 3. & 3 & 3
           \end{array}$$
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
