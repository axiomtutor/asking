    <h1>Arithmetic</h1>
    <p>We're going to obviously do a lot of calculations in this class so let's make sure you recall the fundamentals, boring as it might be.</p>
    <h2>Adding all kinds of *&^#</h2>
    <p>Of course you all recall how to add 123+456 kind of stuff.  How about 1.23 + 45.6?  The key is to line up the decimal point and add like usual.  Same thing goes for subtraction.  You should test yourself to make sure you got this.  If you do it right, you should get that 1.23+45.6 is 46.83.</p>
    <p>Now how about adding negatives?  You might have forgotten this depending on how long ago your math class was and how far you went.  What is -12+3?  Step one is to determine what the sign is.  The negative is "bigger" than the positive so the answer is going to be negative.  Next, because one is positive and the other is negative they're going to cancel, not combine.  Therefore we'll take the difference of 12 and 3 which is 9.  Put it all together now and the result is -9.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>Compute the following.</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-(-4.56)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>First notice the negative is larger (it's the -4.56 because subtraction is just like adding with a negative).  Since the signs are opposite we're going to cancel so we subtract.  It'll be easier to do if we put the larger number first.</p>
          $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
           & 4. & 5 & 6\\
          -& 1. & 2 & 3 \\\hline
           & 3. & 3 & 3
           \end{array}$$
           <p>So the solution is -3.33.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Since both numbers are negative the result is just going to be a negative number which combines them.  So we might as well just add 
            
            $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
             & 4. & 5 & 6\\
            +& 1. & 2 & 3 \\\hline
             & 5. & 7 & 9
             \end{array}$$
          and so the answer is -5.79.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Here you have to recall that subtracting a negative just list adding.  The negatives cancel, so that this is the same thing as -1.23+4.56.  Now the bigger number is positive so the answer will be positive.  But since the signs are different we have to cancel.  Therefore we perform the subtraction just like in the first exercise, and it comes out to 3.33.  Since the answer stays positive this time, this is the answer.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Now recall how to add fractions.  If the denominator is the same the process is easy: <i>Just keep the denominator and add the numerator.</i>  For instance 1/2 + 1/2 is 2/2.  And of course we can simplify that as just 1.  Subtraction works the same way.</p>
    <p>What about adding when the denominators are different?  How do you add 1/2 + 1/3?  The key is to split the 1/2 into three pieces and split the 1/3 in two pieces.  1/2 divided into 3 pieces gives you 3 pieces each with size 1/6, so it's the same as 3/6.  1/3 split in 2 pieces gives you 2 pieces each with size 1/6 so it's 2/6.  So now we know that 1/2 + 1/3 is the same as 3/6 + 2/6 and we can use the old rule for adding fractions with the same denominator.  It's 5/6.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>What is 1/3-1/2?</p>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>-1/6</p>
    <h2>Multiplication</h2>
    <p>You probably recall how to multiply large numbers like 12*45 but just to be sure, recall that you multiply the first number by each digit of the second number, but as you go you offset the digits. </p>
    
    $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
     &  & 1 & 2\\
    \times&  & 4 & 5 \\\hline
     & & 6 & 0 \\
     & 4 & 8 & 0 \\
     \end{array}$$
     
     <p>Notice that you have to do some "carrying" to get this result, but I don't show that since it can confuse the picture.  Then you take these rows and add them.</p>
     
     $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
      &  & 1 & 2\\
     \times&  & 4 & 5 \\\hline
      & & 6 & 0 \\
      +& 4 & 8 & 0 \\\hline
       & 5 & 4 & 0
      \end{array}$$
     <p>Ok, but how do you multiply decimals?  Here's how I do it:  Multiply them like there's no decimal at all.  Then put the decimals back in at the end.  So if you multiply 1.2*4.5 I would do it like this: Multiply 12*45 and get 540.  Now the first one had a decimal so you change it to 54.0.  The second one also had a decimal so you change it to 5.4.  Now you have the answer.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Find 12.5 * 1.01.</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>If we multiply like there's no decimals we find 125*101.  You can use the table method you see above, or you can do a little trick.  125*101 is almost the same thing as 125*100 and that's 12500.  To get the last multiple of 1 just add on 125 to this.  Now you get 12625.</p>
     <p>Ok, now that we know 125*101 is 12625, we put the decimals back in.  The first number had one decimal so we change it to 1262.5.  The second number had two decimals so we change the answer to 12.625 and we're done.</p>
     <p>Getting back to different kinds of multiplication, how do you multiply negatives?  What's 2*(-3)?
     <ol>
         <li>If the numbers have the same sign, the multiplication is positive.</li>
         <li>If the numbers have different signs, the result is negative.</li>
         <li>In both cases, you'll still just multiply the numbers without signs.</li>
       </ol>  
     Using that rule, we know the result will be negative.  So we just multiply 2*3 and get 6.  So the answer is -6.  These rules should make it clear that -2*(-3) is 6.</p>
     <p>And finally, how do you multiply fractions?  What is 1/2 * 1/3?  The answer is <i>you just multiply tops with tops and bottoms with bottoms.</i>  So to get the top we do 1*1 which is 1.  To get the bottom we do 2*3 which is 6.  The answer is 1/6.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Go to Khan Academy and find their exercises for arithmetic.  They randomly generate problems and you can enter your answer to check yourself.  You can do this infinitely many times, so it's a great way to practice until you feel good.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Calculate \(\frac{1}{2}\times 3\).</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>The rule is to multiply tops with tops and bottoms with bottoms ... but 3 doesn't have a top and a bottom.  What do you do?  Well you have to re-write it so that it does.  3 is the same as 3/1.  So now we multiply
     $$\frac 1 2 \times \frac 3 1$$ 
     and get 3/2.
     </p>
     <h2>Division</h2>
     <p>
       For some numbers it's obvious you can't do any really good division.  Like what's 1 divided by 2?  Well really all you can say is it's 1/2 which isn't much better than just saying "1 divided by 2".  But for other numbers division is more useful, like 24/6 = 4.  For big numbers, we need a method to help us keep track of what we're doing.  For example if we want to calculate 12625/125 we need to find the biggest number we can multiply by 125 and stay under 12625.  We can start by writing the numbers like this: 
     
       $$
       \require{enclose}
  \begin{array}{rll}
   125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex 
  \end{array}
       $$
       
       and we start by trying to fit 125 into 126 (we can't hope to fit it in 1 or 12, so we start with 126).  It goes in once, so we write 
     
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           1\ \ \ \ && \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex 
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       then multiply \(125\times 1\) and get 125, put that underneath, subtract.
     
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           1\phantom{00}&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          1\phantom{00}
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       next carry a digit from the 12625
       
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           1\phantom{00}&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          12\phantom{20}
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       Since this "goes in" 0 times, we record the 0 and bring down another digit.
       
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           10\phantom{0}&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          125
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       This goes in 1 time so we record it
       
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           101&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          125
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       multiply 125*1 and subtract.
       
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           101&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          125 && \\
          \underline{-125} && \\
          0 &&
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       And since we've ended with a 0 the division is done.  What this shows is that $$12625/125 = 101$$  
       Of course equivalent to this fact is the fact that 
       $$12625 = 125\times 101$$
       which is the same thing we saw in the section on multiplication.
     </p>
     <p>Division of decimals is like multiplication with decimals: Do it without the decimals and add them back in.  The only difference is that you add back in the decimals that were in the <i>numerator</i>.  You subtract out decimals that were in the <i>denominator.</i>  So if you had to divide 126.25/12.5 the result would be 101 if we ignore the decimals.  Then we add in the two decimals from the numerator to get 1.01.  But we move the decimal in the other direction because of the one decimal in 12.5.  That means we end with 10.1.</p>

         <li>What is 5/0.1?</li>
       </ol>
     </p>
     <h3>Answers</h3>
     <p>
       <ol>
         <li>If you ignore the decimal we're basically calculating 2/200.  If you compute this like we did above, you should get 
       
         $$\require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
          0.01 && \\
          200 \enclose{longdiv}{2.00}
         \end{array}
         $$
         
         This is telling us that 2/200 is 0.01.  But because of the three decimals that the original numerator had, we move the decimal left three times.  That gives us 0.00001.</li>
         <li>For this we ignore decimals and compute 5/1 we already know that comes out to 5.  But because of the decimal in the bottom we move the decimal place <i>right</i> by 1.  So we get 50.</li>
       </ol>
     </p>
     <p>The rule for negatives is just like the one for multiplication.  If you have two negatives or two positives the result is positive.  If you have one negative, one positive, the result is negative.  But otherwise you just do the division while ignoring the sign.</p>
     <p>For fractions we use the "flip and multiply rule".  How does that go again?  How do you compute, for example, \(\frac{1/2}{3}\)?  Do you flip the 1/2?</p>
     <p>NO.  The rule doesn't have the best name since it doesn't tell you what to flip.  You <i>flip the denominator.</i>  In this case that's 3, which again we have to write as 3/1 before we can apply the rule.  But now if we write it as \(\frac{1/2}{3/1}\) then to flip (the denominator) and multiply we do 
     $$\frac 1 2 \times \frac 1 3$$
     How do we finish the calculation?  Recall how to multiply fractions.  Multipy tops with tops, bottoms with bottoms.  Then you get the answer, 1/6.
     </p>
     <h2>Exponents, roots, logs</h2>
     <p>Just like multiplication means repeated addition, exponentiation means repeated multiplication.  So 3*4 means 3+3+3+3 which is 12.  Or does it mean 4+4+4?  Well since that's also 12 it doesn't matter.</p>
     <p>Anyway, 3<sup>4</sup> means 3*3*3*3 which is 81.  Or is it 4*4*4 which is 64?  This time they're different so we better make sure we get it right.  3<sup>4</sup> is in fact the first one, so it's 81.</p>
     <p>Now every operation we've seen so far has an <b>inverse</b>.  For addition the inverse is subtraction.  For multiplication the inverse is division.  What's the inverse for exponentiation?  Well we have to get clear about what exactly an inverse even means.  With addition an inverse looks like this
      $$
      3+4-4 = 3
      $$ 
      which says that if you add 4 and then subtract 4 your right back to where you started.  The same idea is true for division.
      $$
      3\times 4 \div 4 = 3
      $$
      (In fact this is basically why you can't divide by 0. It's related to the fact that ANY number times 0 is 0.)  Notice that because + and &div; have a symmetry to them, it doesn't matter what order we do it in.  
      $$4+3-4 = 3$$
      $$4\times 3\div 4 = 3$$
      But that's not true with exponents.  We already saw that the order matters.  What that means is that there are TWO kinds of inverses for exponents.  The first one is what we call the <b>root</b>.  It cancels the exponent and leaves the base.  The most famous root is the square root, which cancels a square.
      $$\sqrt{4^2} = 4$$
      In effect this shows you that \(\sqrt{16}=4\).  
     </p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Show that \(\sqrt{25}=5\).</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>This is because 
     $$\sqrt{25} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5$$
     </p>
     <p>Now getting back to the lesson, is should be clear that \(\sqrt{1}=1\) and \(\sqrt{0}=0\) which are often useful to know because they're so easy to calculate. </p>
     <p>But the square root isn't the only root.  There's also the cube-root which cancels cubes.  Since \(\sqrt[3]{2^3} = 2\) this shows us that \(\sqrt[3]{8}=2\). </p>
     <p>
       But I promised you something else too.  I promised there was a second way to cancel exponential expressions and this one <i>cancels the base and leaves the exponent</i>.  This is called the <b>logarithm</b>.  For example
       $$
       \log_3(3^4) = 4
       $$
       This tells us that 
       $$
       \log_3(81) = 4
       $$
     </p>

     <h1>Percents</h1>
     <h2>The basic idea</h2>
     <p>The idea of percents and calculating with percents will be very important throughout this class.  And they often confuse people, so let's spend some quality time on this.</p>
     <p>Take a group of college students with different majors.  If 40% are public health majors then you would expect that in a random sample of 100 students, 40 will be public health majors.  This makes the percentage seem like a rate.  "For every 100 students you get 40 public health majors."  If you double the number of students to 200 you get 80 public health majors.  </p>
     <p>If the numbers are easy to relate to 100 there isn't much challenge. How many public health majors are in a typical random sample of 50 students?  20. But what about the typical number of public health majors in a selection of 13 students?</p>
     <p>The answer is 13*40%.  To compute this you just do 13*40/100 or if you prefer, it's the same thing as 13*0.4.  Either way you get 5.2.  Notice how this method agrees with what we saw earlier.  To get the number of public health majors in 100 students you could compute 100*40%.  This computes to 40.  The number in 200 students is 200*40% which is 80.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Find 21% of 111.</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>(21%)*111 = 21*111/100 = (111+2220)/100 = 2331/100 = 23.31</p>
     <p>Another way to think about percent is that it is the "part over whole".  For example if you have 100 people and 40 of them are public health majors, the percentage of public health majors is 40/100 which is the same as 40%.  If there are 6 friends and 4 are women, what is the percentage of women?  4/6 which is part over whole.  We can then re-express 4/6 as 0.66 (approximately).  Since percentages are written as "over 100" we can take 0.66 * 100 / 100. And this tells us it's 66/100 and that's 66%.  Now that it's in true percentage form we're done.   </p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>If 10 cars on a parking lot are green and there are 68 cars, what is the percent of green cars?  What is the percent of cars that aren't green?</p>
     <h3>Answers</h3>
     <p>10/68 of the cars are green, and that's about 0.15.  Converting to percentage form as above you get 15%.  Notice that converting to a percent is always just moving the decimal right by two.</p>
     <p>Also it should be intuitive that percentages of all groups add up to 100%.  If you have toys of colors red, green, blue, and white, then the percentages can't be 50%, 20%, 30%, and 10%.  In fact if you find the first three percentages that should be enough information to figure out the last percentage.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>If toys come in red, green, blue, and white, and the percentage of red is 50%, green is 20%, blue is 30%, what is the percentage of white?  If there is a total of 1000 toys, how many are of each color?</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>Red, gree, and blue together already make up 100%, so the percentage of white must be 0%.  That is the same as there being 0 white toys.  The amounts of the other toys must be 500, 200, and 300.</p>
     <h2>Parts of parts</h2>
     <p>Suppose you have college majors, some of them are public health majors, some not; some of them are men and some not.  We can describe them on a two-way table (can be called a "contingency table").</p>
     <table>
       <tr>
         <th> </th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>PH</th>
         <td>10</td>
         <td>20</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>Other</th>
         <td>40</td>
         <td>30</td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>This expresses, for example, there are 10 male public health majors, and there are 30 female students who are not public health majors.  We can compute the percent of the group that's male; that's 50/100 or 50%.  Clearly the percent that are female is the same.  The percent that are public health majors is 40/100 or 40%.  Notice that there are two ways to get the percent of non-public health majors: You could compute 100%-40% or you could just count up the "Other" row and get 60/100.</p>
     <p>These percentages are often called <b>marginal percents</b> because they can be computed by putting totals on the margins of the table.</p>
     <table>
       <tr>
         <th> </th><th>Male</th><th>Female</th><th>TOTALS</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>PH</th>
         <td>10</td>
         <td>20</td>
         <td>30</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>Other</th>
         <td>40</td>
         <td>30</td>
         <td>70</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>TOTALS</th>
         <td>50</td>
         <td>50</td>
         <td>100</td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     <p>But not only that, we can also compute <b>joint percents</b>.  For instance the percent of students who are both male and public health majors is 10/100 or 10%.  You can get similar joint percentages for every other cell of the table.</p>
     <p>Finally there's another kind of percent you can calculate, the <b>conditional percent</b>.  What is the percent OF MALES who are public health majors?  10/50 = 20%.</p>

     <p>An interesting question, though, is: what if I told you that a group of students is 40% male and of the males 10% are public heatlh majors?  Can we say the number of male public health majors?  You could do this by assigning arbitrary quantities to the total number of students, like say there are 100 students.  Then 40 are male.  Of the 40 males, 10% are public health majors so that's 4 people who are both male and public health majors.  Then the joint percent of male public health majors is 4/100 or 4%.</p>
     <p>Notice that we would have obtained the same answer without making up numbers.  You could just compute 40% * 10% which is (40/100)*(10/100) which is (4/10)*(1/10) = 4/100 = 4%.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Suppose a chemical solution is made up of 30% chemical A.  But chemical A is itself 60% nitrogen.  How much nitrogen (as a percent of the total) is coming from chemical A?  </p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>We could make up an amount of the total chemical like 100 gallons and then 30 gallons of chemical A are in it.  Then 60% of those 30 gallons are nitrogen.  So there are (60%)*30 gallons of nitrogen from chemical A.  That's (60/100)*30 = 6*3 = 18.  Since this is 18 gallons out of a total of 100 gallons, that's 18% of the total which is nitrogen coming from chemical A.</p>
    <p>Of course we could also have simply computed (30%)*(60%) to get the same answer.</p>
