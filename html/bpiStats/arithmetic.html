    <h1>Arithmetic</h1>
    <p>We're going to obviously do a lot of calculations in this class so let's make sure you recall the fundamentals, boring as it might be.</p>
    <h2>Adding all kinds of *&^#</h2>
    <p>Of course you all recall how to add 123+456 kind of stuff.  How about 1.23 + 45.6?  The key is to line up the decimal point and add like usual.  Same thing goes for subtraction.  You should test yourself to make sure you got this.  If you do it right, you should get that 1.23+45.6 is 46.83.</p>
    <p>Now how about adding negatives?  You might have forgotten this depending on how long ago your math class was and how far you went.  What is -12+3?  Step one is to determine what the sign is.  The negative is "bigger" than the positive so the answer is going to be negative.  Next, because one is positive and the other is negative they're going to cancel, not combine.  Therefore we'll take the difference of 12 and 3 which is 9.  Put it all together now and the result is -9.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>Compute the following.</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-4.56</li>
        <li>-1.23-(-4.56)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>First notice the negative is larger (it's the -4.56 because subtraction is just like adding with a negative).  Since the signs are opposite we're going to cancel so we subtract.  It'll be easier to do if we put the larger number first.</p>
          $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
           & 4. & 5 & 6\\
          -& 1. & 2 & 3 \\\hline
           & 3. & 3 & 3
           \end{array}$$
           <p>So the solution is -3.33.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Since both numbers are negative the result is just going to be a negative number which combines them.  So we might as well just add 
            
            $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
             & 4. & 5 & 6\\
            +& 1. & 2 & 3 \\\hline
             & 5. & 7 & 9
             \end{array}$$
          and so the answer is -5.79.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Here you have to recall that subtracting a negative just list adding.  The negatives cancel, so that this is the same thing as -1.23+4.56.  Now the bigger number is positive so the answer will be positive.  But since the signs are different we have to cancel.  Therefore we perform the subtraction just like in the first exercise, and it comes out to 3.33.  Since the answer stays positive this time, this is the answer.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Now recall how to add fractions.  If the denominator is the same the process is easy: <i>Just keep the denominator and add the numerator.</i>  For instance 1/2 + 1/2 is 2/2.  And of course we can simplify that as just 1.  Subtraction works the same way.</p>
    <p>What about adding when the denominators are different?  How do you add 1/2 + 1/3?  The key is to split the 1/2 into three pieces and split the 1/3 in two pieces.  1/2 divided into 3 pieces gives you 3 pieces each with size 1/6, so it's the same as 3/6.  1/3 split in 2 pieces gives you 2 pieces each with size 1/6 so it's 2/6.  So now we know that 1/2 + 1/3 is the same as 3/6 + 2/6 and we can use the old rule for adding fractions with the same denominator.  It's 5/6.</p>
    <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
    <p>What is 1/3-1/2?</p>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>-1/6</p>
    <h2>Multiplication</h2>
    <p>You probably recall how to multiply large numbers like 12*45 but just to be sure, recall that you multiply the first number by each digit of the second number, but as you go you offset the digits. </p>
    
    $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
     &  & 1 & 2\\
    \times&  & 4 & 5 \\\hline
     & & 6 & 0 \\
     & 4 & 8 & 0 \\
     \end{array}$$
     
     <p>Notice that you have to do some "carrying" to get this result, but I don't show that since it can confuse the picture.  Then you take these rows and add them.</p>
     
     $$\begin{array}{c c c c}
      &  & 1 & 2\\
     \times&  & 4 & 5 \\\hline
      & & 6 & 0 \\
      +& 4 & 8 & 0 \\\hline
       & 5 & 4 & 0
      \end{array}$$
     <p>Ok, but how do you multiply decimals?  Here's how I do it:  Multiply them like there's no decimal at all.  Then put the decimals back in at the end.  So if you multiply 1.2*4.5 I would do it like this: Multiply 12*45 and get 540.  Now the first one had a decimal so you change it to 54.0.  The second one also had a decimal so you change it to 5.4.  Now you have the answer.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Find 12.5 * 1.01.</p>
     <h3>Answer</h3>
     <p>If we multiply like there's no decimals we find 125*101.  You can use the table method you see above, or you can do a little trick.  125*101 is almost the same thing as 125*100 and that's 12500.  To get the last multiple of 1 just add on 125 to this.  Now you get 12625.</p>
     <p>Ok, now that we know 125*101 is 12625, we put the decimals back in.  The first number had one decimal so we change it to 1262.5.  The second number had two decimals so we change the answer to 12.625 and we're done.</p>
     <p>Getting back to different kinds of multiplication, how do you multiply negatives?  What's 2*(-3)?
     <ol>
         <li>If the numbers have the same sign, the multiplication is positive.</li>
         <li>If the numbers have different signs, the result is negative.</li>
         <li>In both cases, you'll still just multiply the numbers without signs.</li>
       </ol>  
     Using that rule, we know the result will be negative.  So we just multiply 2*3 and get 6.  So the answer is -6.  These rules should make it clear that -2*(-3) is 6.</p>
     <p>And finally, how do you multiply fractions?  What is 1/2 * 1/3?  The answer is <i>you just multiply tops with tops and bottoms with bottoms.</i>  So to get the top we do 1*1 which is 1.  To get the bottom we do 2*3 which is 6.  The answer is 1/6.</p>
     <h3>Test your understanding</h3>
     <p>Go to Khan Academy and find their exercises for arithmetic.  They randomly generate problems and you can enter your answer to check yourself.  You can do this infinitely many times, so it's a great way to practice until you feel good.</p>
     <h3>Division</h3>
     <p>
       For some numbers it's obvious you can't do any really good division.  Like what's 1 divided by 2?  Well really all you can say is it's 1/2 which isn't much better than just saying "1 divided by 2".  But for other numbers division is more useful, like 24/6 = 4.  For big numbers, we need a method to help us keep track of what we're doing.  For example if we want to calculate 12625/125 we need to find the biggest number we can multiply by 125 and stay under 12625.  We can start by writing the numbers like this: 
     
       $$
       \require{enclose}
  \begin{array}{rll}
   125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex 
  \end{array}
       $$
       
       and we start by trying to fit 125 into 126 (we can't hope to fit it in 1 or 12, so we start with 126).  It goes in once, so we write 
     
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           1\ \ \ \ && \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex 
         \end{array}
       $$
       
       then multiply \(125\times 1\) and get 125, put that underneath, subtract.
     
       $$
         \require{enclose}
         \begin{array}{rll}
           1\phantom{00}&& \\[-3pt]
          125 \enclose{longdiv}{12625}\kern-.2ex \\[-3pt]
          \underline{-125\phantom{00}} && \\
          1\phantom{00}
         \end{array}
       $$
